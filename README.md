# Borg (v0.10.0)

> The Unified AI Operations Control Plane.

Borg is a high-performance local control plane designed to sit between AI agents and their underlying infrastructure. It transforms standard agent interactions into a sophisticated, multi-tiered cognitive workflow with integrated memory, real-time observability, and autonomous "auto-drive" capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Advanced Multi-Tier Memory
Borg implements a sophisticated memory architecture inspired by `Mem0` and `Letta`, ensuring agents never "forget" across sessions:
- **Automatic Context Harvesting**: Borg silently extracts facts, concepts, and technical entities from every conversation and tool execution.
- **LanceDB Vector Storage**: High-speed local vector database for long-term semantic retrieval.
- **Graph-Based Knowledge**: Tracks relationships between files, tasks, and concepts via `GraphMemory`, allowing for high-level architectural reasoning.
- **Context Compacting & Pruning**: Automatically compresses chat history and prunes redundant data to maintain optimal context window efficiency.

### ⚡ One-Shot Discovery & Execution
The "Meta-Tool" architecture eliminates the turn-latency of traditional tool use:
- **`auto_call_tool`**: Describe an objective in plain language; Borg searches for the right tool, maps arguments using a background LLM, and executes it in a single step.
- **Dynamic Advertising**: Borg only advertises core Meta-Tools by default to stay under LLM limits. It summons the full power of hundreds of MCP tools on-demand.

### 🌐 Universal MCP Master Router
Aggregate hundreds of MCP servers behind one endpoint. Borg manages connections, tool conflicts, and namespacing automatically.

### 👁️ Real-Time "Local LLM" Watcher
Borg runs background "Copilot" logic through the `SuggestionService`:
- **Preemptive Injection**: As you browse code or chat, Borg semantically predicts your next move and injects clickable tool suggestions into the UI.
- **Thematic Comprehension**: Understands when you are debugging, researching, or refactoring, and surface relevant skills/tools automatically.

### 🚑 Auto-Drive & Autonomous Healing
The `Director` and `HealerService` provide a safety net for autonomous operations:
- **Conversation Monitoring**: A background daemon watches chat logs and terminal outputs.
- **Self-Healing**: When a test fails or a process crashes, the Healer analyzes the stack trace, generates a fix, and proposes it for approval.
- **Handoff & Pickup**: Automatically summarizes sessions into "Bootstrap Prompts" so agents can resume work exactly where they left off.

## 📖 How to Use Borg

### 1. Connect your AI Agent
Borg acts as a standard MCP server that routes to all other servers. Connect your preferred AI (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.) to the Borg entry point:

**Standard Stdio Connection:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "borg": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/borg/packages/core/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. The "One-Shot" Workflow (Recommended)
Instead of asking the model to find a tool, give it the objective directly. Borg will handle the discovery and execution in one turn.

*   **Agent Call**: `auto_call_tool({ objective: "Search my emails for the invoice from last Tuesday and save it to the project folder", context: "Tuesday was March 10th" })`
*   **Borg Action**: Automatically finds the `gmail` and `filesystem` tools, maps the arguments, and executes.

### 3. The Discovery Workflow
If you want to manually manage your active tools:
1.  **Search**: `search_tools({ query: "how do I interact with jira?" })`
2.  **Load**: `load_tool({ name: "jira__create_issue" })`
3.  **Execute**: Use the newly hydrated tool normally.

### 4. Mission Control Dashboard
Open `http://localhost:3001/dashboard` to:
- **Toggle Functions**: Instantly enable/disable any sidebar feature or MCP integration.
- **Monitor Swarms**: See live logs and memory graphs of all active agent sessions.
- **Manage Quotas**: View LLM provider spend and health in one place.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

1. **Discovery**: `search_tools(query)` -> Semantic ranked matches.
2. **Loading**: `load_tool(name)` -> Hydrates specific tool schemas.
3. **Execution**: `auto_call_tool(objective, context)` -> One-shot magic.
4. **Memory**: `save_memory` / `search_memory` -> Persistent cross-session intelligence.

## 🔐 Security & Trust Model

Borg is designed as a **local-first control plane**. You should treat it as a high-privilege operator process in your development environment.

### What Borg does (and does not) assume
- Borg assumes you trust the local machine and user account running it.
- Borg does **not** require a hosted Borg backend for core operation.
- Borg can call external MCP servers/tools, so security posture depends on what you connect.

### Trust boundaries
- **Local process boundary**: Borg, your MCP clients, and local tools run with local user permissions.
- **Network boundary**: Any remote MCP endpoint or API provider is outside the local trust boundary.
- **Secret boundary**: Secrets/API keys are your responsibility and should be injected via environment/config, not committed to git.

### Operational hardening recommendations
- Run Borg with a least-privilege user account.
- Scope API keys to minimum permissions and rotate regularly.
- Review enabled MCP servers/tools and disable anything not needed.
- Isolate sensitive workloads in separate environments/projects.
- Audit logs regularly for unexpected tool executions.

### Repository safety basics
- Never commit real secrets; use templates such as `.env.example`.
- Runtime-generated files (for example `packages/cli/.borg-session.json`) may change frequently and can be locally excluded from git noise when needed.

## 🏁 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ | `pnpm` 10+
- Docker Desktop (Optional)

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Option B: Local Development
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Local Git Hygiene (runtime session file)

`packages/cli/.borg-session.json` is updated at runtime (for example `lastHeartbeat`) and can appear as a local change even when source code is clean.

If you want to keep your working tree clean locally, mark it as skip-worktree:

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/cli/.borg-session.json
```

To undo that local-only behavior later:

```bash
git update-index --no-skip-worktree packages/cli/.borg-session.json
```

# Borg MCP

**The trustworthy intelligence layer for the entire published MCP ecosystem.**

Borg is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) control plane that intelligently discovers, configures, tests, verifies, and persists every published MCP server into a first-class, database-backed catalog.

Instead of mythologizing capabilities, Borg prioritizes **truth**: real provenance, automated validation, confidence-scored configuration recipes, and transparent operator workflows.

## Core Principles

- **Truth before polish**
- **Verification before parity**
- **Catalog, don’t mythologize**
- Intelligence layer first — orchestration, memory, and swarm capabilities second

## Current Focus (2026)

**Phase B – MCP Registry Intelligence Program**

We are building the definitive catalog of every published MCP server with:
- Automated discovery and ingestion from public registries
- Provenance tracking and deduplication
- Intelligent transport-aware config recipe generation
- Safe, automated validation harness (`tools/list`, transport probes, sandboxed `tools/call`)
- Full operator workflow: discover → normalize → configure → test → certify → install

Installed servers remain separate from the published catalog to maintain truthfulness.

## Project Layout

- `packages/core/` – Canonical control plane, session supervisor, provider routing
- `packages/registry/` – New database-backed published MCP catalog and intelligence services
- `packages/cli/` – Updated Borg CLI (legacy `mcp-router-cli` paths being rationalized)
- `apps/dashboard/` – New registry intelligence dashboard
- `docs/` – Architecture decision records, API specs, validation harness docs

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install
bun install

# Start development registry intelligence services
bun run dev:registry

# Run validation harness tests
bun run test:validation

See ROADMAP.md, VISION.md, and TODO.md for detailed current priorities.
Status

    1.0 – Production-ready control plane and session management
    1.1 (in progress) – MCP Registry Intelligence (catalog, validation, config intelligence)
    Memory, swarm, and broad ecosystem parity are deliberately deprioritized until the catalog foundation is complete.

We are Borg. First we ingest, normalize, test, and make truthful. Then we orchestrate.


# Borg: Local-First MCP Control Plane

> **Truthful, lazy-loaded, worktree-isolated MCP orchestration**

Borg is a control plane for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents and resources with emphasis on:
- **Local-first operation**: Zero external dependencies for core functionality
- **Truthfulness**: Cryptographic provenance tracking for all context
