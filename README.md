## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛠️ Ultimate Tool Dashboard
- **Inventory Management:** Track installation status of local AI tools (Aider, Docker, Redis, Bun).

- **Process Guardian:** Long-running service that monitors and restarts crashed background processes.
- **Hardware Stats:** Real-time CPU, VRAM, RAM, and Disk usage monitoring.

### 🧠 The "Director" Autonomous Agent
- **Auto-Drive:** Fully autonomous development loop that reads `task.md`, plans next steps, and executes them.
- **Council Consensus:** Multi-persona LLM debate engine (Architect, Guardian, Optimizer) that reviews high-stakes decisions.
- **Memory RAG:** Vector-based code indexing and semantic search for context-aware coding.
- **Skill Installer:** Dynamic capability expansion via `mcpm_install` (Git-based skills).
- **Configurable Control:** Real-time settings adjustment and persistence via Dashboard.

### 🔌 Universal MCP Control Plane
- **Core Server:** Central orchestrator connecting Native IDE, Web Dashboard, and Browser Extension.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Smart routing of prompts to specific tools (Native vs Web).
- **Skill Registry:** Expandable skill plugins for specialized tasks.

### 🖥️ High-Fidelity Dashboard
- **Mission Control:** Process monitoring, auto-restarts, and system status.
- **Skills UI:** Browse and manage installed capabilities.
- **Reader UI:** Test the web scraper/page reader.
- **Submodule Manager:** Visual git submodule health check and healing.
- **Council Config:** Manage personas and context files.
