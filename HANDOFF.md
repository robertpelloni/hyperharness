# Handoff — Stabilization Session

## Current status
**Version:** `1.0.0-alpha.1`

We have addressed a major split-brain issue between the MCP database cache and the lightweight stdio loader that was causing models to see only 1 tool (`borg_core_loader_status`) and losing the `always_on` setting across restarts.

## Key technical discoveries & fixes

1. **The Config Deletion Loop**
   - **Bug**: `McpConfigService.syncWithDatabase()` was reading the user's `mcp.jsonc` file. If the file lacked cached tools under `_meta.tools` (which was the default state for many servers), it passed an empty array to `toolsRepository.syncTools()`. This caused the repository to execute a DELETE query against all 651 tools in the database, wiping out their `always_on` status.
   - **Fix**: Modified `McpConfigService.ts` to strictly prevent `syncStoredMetadataTools` from overwriting or deleting DB tools if the incoming `mcp.jsonc` array is empty.

2. **The Stdio Loader Blindspot**
   - **Bug**: The `stdioLoader.ts` script (which `pi` and other extensions connect to) was explicitly bypassing the database to remain lightweight. It only read from `mcp.jsonc`. Because the tools were only in the DB and not in `mcp.jsonc` (or were wiped), the proxy served 0 downstream tools.
   - **Fix**: We changed `syncToMcpJson` to `exportToolCache` and made it write to `.borg/mcp-cache.json`. This new unified cache merges both the SQLite database inventory and the manual `mcp.jsonc` configurations without destroying the manual file. The `stdioLoader` now reads `mcp-cache.json`.

3. **Workspace Config Resolution**
   - **Bug**: The system hardcoded `os.homedir() + '/.borg'` for the configuration directory, causing confusion when a local `mcp.jsonc` existed at the project root.
   - **Fix**: Updated `getBorgConfigDir()` in `mcpJsonConfig.ts` to respect `process.env.BORG_CONFIG_DIR`, then check for `process.cwd()/mcp.jsonc`, and finally fall back to the home directory.

4. **Tool Inventory Merging**
   - **Bug**: `getCachedToolInventory()` returned either the SQLite snapshot OR the JSON snapshot, but never both.
   - **Fix**: Rewrote the function to cleanly merge both collections, ensuring manual API-imported servers and auto-discovered DB servers coexist.

5. **Universal Instructions Refactor**
   - Rewrote `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `GPT.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to cleanly point back to `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, reducing prompt bloat and ensuring architectural alignment across models.

## Next steps for the next agent
1. **Validate Stdio Loader**: Run `pi` or test the stdio proxy directly to ensure it now broadcasts the combined DB and manual tool inventory.
2. **Dashboard Review**: Check if the `always_on` toggles in the React dashboard correctly persist across server restarts now that the destructive wipe bug is gone.
3. **Continue Porting**: The Go bridge needs more direct mappings. Evaluate `PORTING_MAP.md` and continue porting features safely without violating the `UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` stabilization rule.
