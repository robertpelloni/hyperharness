# Handoff

## What was done
- Added a Go-native foundation bootstrap for a Pi-derived harness:
  - `foundation/pi`
  - `foundation/compat`
  - `foundation/assimilation`
  - `cmd/foundation.go`
- Extended the bootstrap into a **truthful native runtime baseline**:
  - native `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash` handlers
  - evented runtime execution
  - JSONL-backed session persistence with create/list/load/fork
  - CLI execution and session management commands under `foundation`
- Added the first native **Aider-inspired repo map baseline**:
  - ranked source scanning
  - lightweight symbol extraction
  - deterministic `<repo_map>` output
  - `hypercode foundation repomap`
- Strengthened repo-map quality with first **graph-ranking groundwork**:
  - files that reference symbols defined in other files now push ranking weight toward those defining files
  - mention-based ranking still works, but cross-file code relationships now matter too
- Routed top-level tool registration closer to the new foundation:
  - `tools.Registry` now exposes exact-name native Pi-compatible tools from `foundation/pi`
  - `agent.Agent` now registers per-tool schemas instead of one placeholder schema
  - legacy `tools/repomap.go` now delegates to `foundation/repomap`
- Added the first HyperCode/Borg adapter seam:
  - `foundation/adapters/hypercode.go` exposes assimilation status, memory context, provider status, MCP config visibility, and adjacent HyperCode repo discovery
  - `foundation/adapters/providers.go` exposes current provider/model visibility, detected providers, Ollama model discovery, and provider-route selection groundwork
  - `foundation/adapters/provider_routing.go` provides shared route-selection logic for CLI and HTTP surfaces
  - `foundation/adapters/provider_execution.go` provides shared provider execution-preparation behavior for CLI, HTTP, and provider stubs
  - `foundation/adapters/mcp_config.go` and `foundation/adapters/mcp.go` expose MCP config parsing, server discovery, tool hints, route hints, mediated tool-call preparation, and configured-server startup seams
  - `hypercode foundation adapters` now inspects that seam directly
  - `agent.Agent` now incorporates adapter-derived system context into its system prompt
- Migrated more top-level surfaces onto the foundation/adapter layer:
  - `mcp/client.go`, `mcp/manager.go`, and `mcp/config.go` now consume adapter-backed behavior
  - `cmd/foundation_http.go` provides reusable foundation-backed HTTP helpers
  - `cmd/serve.go` now exposes `/api/v1/foundation/*` endpoints and routes `/fs/read` through the foundation `read` tool
  - foundation-backed MCP HTTP helper and route surfaces now expose MCP tool listing and mediated call preparation
  - foundation-backed provider helper and route surfaces now expose provider visibility, route selection, and execution preparation
  - foundation-backed orchestration helper and route surfaces now expose plan generation
  - `hypercode foundation providers status/select/prepare` now exposes provider routing groundwork from the CLI
  - `hypercode foundation plan` now exposes orchestration planning from the CLI
  - `agents/provider_stub.go` and `agents/provider.go` now consume provider execution-preparation hints
  - `agents/director.go` and `agent/orchestrator.go` now consume `foundation/orchestration` planning primitives
  - `orchestrator/webhooks.go`, daemon sweep planning, and autodrive objective generation now consume foundation orchestration helpers
  - `tui/slash.go` now exposes foundation-backed `/plan`, `/repomap`, `/providers`, `/adapters`, and `/mcp`
  - `tui/foundation_bridge.go` now routes normal prompt and shell proposal flows through foundation-aware helpers
  - `tui/slash.go` now exposes foundation-backed `/plan` and `/repomap` slash commands
- Added deeper verification coverage:
  - snapshot-style tests for baseline tool results
  - top-level agent schema registration test
  - HyperCode/Borg adapter seam test
  - provider adapter seam test
  - provider-route selection test
  - provider execution-preparation test
  - MCP adapter seam tests and top-level MCP package tests
  - foundation-backed HTTP helper tests
  - MCP mediation helper tests
  - orchestration planner, daemon planner, webhook planner, and migrated director/orchestrator tests
  - foundation-backed TUI slash-command tests
  - foundation-backed TUI prompt/shell helper tests
  - provider CLI smoke checks
  - foundation plan CLI smoke checks
  - TUI provider/adapter introspection smoke coverage via tests
- Added comprehensive `docs/ai/` documentation for requirements, design, planning, implementation, and testing.
- Added `docs/ai/design/upstream-toolchain-analysis.md` summarizing the imported upstream systems and assimilation strategy.
- Fixed the duplicate SQLite driver registration issue in `orchestrator/queue.go` and `orchestrator/vectors.go` by removing redundant `modernc.org/sqlite` imports.

## Important repo state notes
- The broader repository still has unrelated baseline failures under full `go test ./...`:
  - `aider/tests/fixtures/languages/go/test.go` has an unused import.
  - `mcp/mcphost_test.go` is out of sync with the host API.
- Many existing Go packages still contain placeholder or aspirational parity logic and should be migrated to the new `foundation/*` packages over time.

## Recommended next steps
1. Continue routing remaining top-level placeholder orchestration/tool surfaces onto the new `foundation/pi` runtime.
2. Expand verified result-shape and snapshot tests for `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash` plus CLI/HTTP smoke coverage.
3. Deepen `foundation/repomap` from graph-ranking groundwork toward fuller Aider-style graph ranking and richer edit engines.
4. Expand `foundation/adapters` from visibility, route-selection, and execution-preparation seams into richer provider routing, memory, and richer MCP runtime adapters backed by HyperCode/Borg.
5. Migrate TUI and orchestration code to the new truthful foundation instead of placeholder parity claims, with special attention to adapter-backed execution paths.
