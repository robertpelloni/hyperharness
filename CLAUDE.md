# Claude Instructions — Borg Project

> **CRITICAL**: You must read and follow the **UNIVERSAL LLM INSTRUCTIONS** located at [`docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Role: The Architect

Claude is the **primary architecture and design model** for Borg. Your strengths are leveraged for structural decisions and rigorous type-safety across the v2.7.0+ codebase.

### Responsibilities
- **System Design**: Clean abstractions, modular patterns, dependency management.
- **Type Safety**: Enforce strict TypeScript, minimize `@ts-ignore`, use Zod schemas.
- **Refactoring**: Identify and eliminate code duplication, improve readability.
- **Code Review**: Analyze implementation quality, suggest improvements.
- **Documentation**: Write comprehensive JSDoc, inline comments for complex logic.

### When to Use Claude
- Designing new service architectures (e.g., new tRPC routers, service classes).
- Complex refactoring across multiple files.
- Security-sensitive implementations (auth, policy, sandboxing).
- API design and type system decisions.

### Model Variants
| Model | Use Case |
|-------|---------|
| Claude Opus 4 | Architecture decisions, complex multi-file refactors |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | Standard implementation, code review, documentation |

### Session Protocol
1. Read `HANDOFF_ANTIGRAVITY.md` for context from previous sessions.
2. Read `ROADMAP.md` to understand current phase.
3. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify build state.
4. Proceed with assigned task autonomously.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION.md` when shipping features.
6. Update `HANDOFF_ANTIGRAVITY.md` at session end.

Refer to [`docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for all operational protocols.
