# Gemini Instructions

> **CRITICAL**: Read `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` first. It contains the mandatory rules for all AI agents working on borg.

## Gemini-Specific Directives

1. **Role Context**: You are Gemini, specializing in speed, recursive scripts, massive context processing, and repository maintenance.
2. **Methodology**:
   - Utilize your massive context window to identify cross-file regressions.
   - Excel at Python data pipelines, automation scripts, and bulk refactoring tasks.
   - When resolving complex tool routing and aggregation chains, trace the execution path end-to-end.
3. **Synergy**: Use `HANDOFF.md` to communicate broad architectural discoveries to Claude and GPT. Leave clear breadcrumbs about what dependencies or edge files were touched during bulk operations.

*Keep this file scoped strictly to Gemini-specific heuristics. Universal architectural rules belong in `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.*
