# Ideas for Improvement: @borg/web

Ambitious features and architectural shifts for the Mission Control dashboard.

## 1. Collaborative Orchestration
- **The "War Room" Mode:** A real-time collaborative environment where multiple human operators can monitor and participate in multi-agent "Squad" sessions, with shared cursors and live annotations.
- **Agent Handoff Streams:** A specialized view for reviewing and approving autonomous handoff prompts between model cycles, with a "diff" view of the context change.
- **Global Mesh Dashboard:** Visualize not just local agents, but the entire global borg network (if opted-in), showing trending MCP tools and collective swarm intelligence.

## 2. Advanced Data Exploration
- **Visual "Knowledge Miner":** A deep-dive exploration tool for the context harvested by Claude-Mem, allowing the operator to trace the lineage of a specific fact or decision through multiple sessions.
- **Semantic Log Analysis:** Instead of raw text logs, provide an AI-summarized "Narrative Log" that describes the agent's intent and outcomes in natural language.
- **Autonomous Report Generator:** A feature that automatically generates professional "State of the Project" reports (PDF/Markdown) based on recent agent activity, git history, and memory.

## 3. Autonomous UX & DX
- **"UX Evolution" System:** A background service that monitors how the operator uses the dashboard and automatically moves frequently used widgets to the home screen.
- **Zero-Config Dashboard:** Automatically detect and enable dashboard modules based on the project's tech stack (e.g., show the "React Expert" panel only if a `package.json` with `react` is found).
- **Embedded Prompt IDE:** A first-class IDE within the dashboard for designing, testing, and versioning system prompts with side-by-side model comparison.

## 4. Architectural Enhancements
- **Streaming-First Architecture:** Migrate all dashboard data fetching to tRPC subscriptions or WebSockets to ensure the UI is always a 1:1 reflection of the orchestrator state without polling.
- **Edge-Cached Context:** Use the browser's IndexedDB to cache large portions of the knowledge graph and session history for near-instant navigation.
- **Plugin-Based Page System:** Allow new dashboard pages to be loaded dynamically as remote components, enabling a community-driven extension ecosystem for the WebUI.
