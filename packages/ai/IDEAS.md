# Ideas for Improvement: @borg/ai

Creative and far-reaching ideas to evolve the model routing and intelligence layer of Borg.

## 1. Architectural Enhancements
- **Rust-based Inference Gateway:** Rewrite the `ModelSelector` and token counting logic in Rust for ultra-low latency routing and zero-overhead quota tracking.
- **WASM Provider Adapters:** Allow providers to be added as sandboxed WASM modules, enabling the community to add support for niche or proprietary LLM APIs without modifying the core.
- **Local-First Embedding Cache:** Implement a persistent, encrypted cache for embeddings generated during routing to minimize redundant API calls and costs.

## 2. Intelligence & Routing
- **Semantic Quota Allocation:** Instead of fixed token counts, allocate "intelligence budgets" based on the complexity of the task (e.g., higher budget for architecture, lower for linting).
- **Real-Time Latency Benchmarking:** Continuously monitor and rank provider response times from the local machine, automatically shifting to faster providers during peak network congestion.
- **Adversarial Token Pruning:** An autonomous agent that pre-processes prompts to remove redundant context and "AI fluff" before sending to expensive models, optimizing context window usage.

## 3. Operations & Economy
- **Dynamic Cost Optimization:** Real-time integration with provider pricing APIs to automatically route queries to the cheapest high-intelligence model available at that exact moment.
- **Quota "Rollover" and Trading:** A conceptual P2P system where Borg nodes can "trade" unused quota allocations via a decentralized ledger (Bobcoin integration).
- **Automated Fine-Tuning Loops:** Automatically capture high-quality agent traces and queue them for local fine-tuning of small models (Gemma/Mistral) to eventually replace expensive API calls for repetitive tasks.

## 4. Developer Experience (DX)
- **Visual Routing Builder:** A drag-and-drop UI in the dashboard to design complex "fallback chains" with conditional logic (e.g., "If context > 32k AND time is night, use Gemini 1.5 Flash").
- **Live "Thought" Stream:** A dedicated dashboard panel that visualizes the `ModelSelector` decision process in real-time, showing why a specific model was chosen.
