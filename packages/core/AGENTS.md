# CORE KNOWLEDGE BASE

**Context:** Node.js | Fastify | Socket.io | Managers | Agent Executor

## OVERVIEW
The "Brain" of the system. Manages MCP connections, agent execution loops, persistent memory, and the Fastify API server. It uses a Manager pattern to handle lifecycle events for different subsystems.

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Director/Council** | `src/agents/Director.ts` / `Council.ts` | Autonomy supervisor with democratic voting |
| **Quota System**    | `src/services/QuotaService.ts` | Token usage and budget tracking |
| **Research Pipeline**| `src/scripts/researchPipeline.ts` | Automated batch link processing |
| **Agent Logic** | `src/agents/AgentExecutor.ts` | The core ReAct loop implementation |
| **LLM Calls** | `src/gateway/ModelGateway.ts` | Centralized LLM interface |
| **State Mgmt** | `src/managers/*Manager.ts` | Stateful subsystems (e.g., `MemoryManager`) |
| **API Handling** | `src/routes/` | HTTP endpoints and SSE streams |

## CONVENTIONS
- **Managers**: All major subsystems must be implemented as a `Manager` class.
- **Async/Await**: Heavy use of async I/O. strictly typed promises.
- **Events**: Uses internal event emitter for cross-manager communication.

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- **Raw Sockets**: Do not handle raw Socket.io events in routes; use the `SocketManager`.
- **Global State**: Avoid global variables; use Manager instances injected or singleton patterns carefully.
- **Blocking Code**: NEVER block the event loop; use `Worker` threads for CPU tasks if needed.
