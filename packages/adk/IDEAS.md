# Ideas for Improvement: @borg/adk

Evolving the Agent Development Kit from a set of interfaces into a high-intelligence framework for autonomous swarm members.

## 1. Interaction & Negotiation
- **Standardized A2A Negotiation Protocols:** Implement formal protocols for agents to negotiate task delegation, resource sharing, and conflict resolution without human intervention.
- **Hierarchical Swarm Routing:** Support for "Parent-Child" agent relationships where a high-intelligence model (e.g., Opus 4.6) orchestrates a fleet of specialized subagents (e.g., Gemini 3 Flash).
- **Consensus-as-a-Service:** A built-in mechanism for agents to initiate a cryptographically signed vote on critical decisions (like merging a large PR).

## 2. Secure Execution & Runtime
- **WASM-Based Tool Runtime:** Allow agents to execute untrusted code or complex tool logic within a secure, high-performance WASM sandbox integrated directly into the ADK.
- **Formal Verification of Tool Effects:** Tools that can provide a "dry run" proof of their intended side effects, allowing the ADK to verify safety before execution.
- **Encrypted Context Passing:** Enforce end-to-end encryption for all data passed between agents, ensuring that sensitive information is never exposed in cleartext logs.

## 3. Intelligence & Personality
- **Autonomous "Agent Personality" Profiles:** Standardized templates for defining agent behaviors, including "risk tolerance," "verbosity," and "architectural philosophy."
- **Self-Documenting Agent Trace:** Automatically generate human-readable technical documentation for every agent session, explaining *why* specific architectural choices were made.
- **Recursive Skill Learning:** An ADK-level feature that allows agents to record successful command sequences and automatically convert them into reusable "Skills" for the wider swarm.

## 4. Developer Experience (DX)
- **Agent Sandbox Simulator:** A local CLI tool to test agent behaviors and tool interactions in a mock environment with simulated network latency and quota failures.
- **Type-Safe Tool Chaining:** A TypeScript DSL for defining complex multi-tool workflows that agents can execute as a single, atomic operation with guaranteed type safety.
- **Live "State of Mind" Telemetry:** Standardized telemetry hooks that allow the ADK to export the agent's current internal goals and confidence levels to the borg dashboard.
