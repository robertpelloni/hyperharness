# Ideas for Improvement: @borg/mcp-client

Evolving the MCP client from a minimal stub into a high-performance, universal tool connector.

## 1. Core Architecture
- **Full MCP 1.0+ Specification Support:** Implement the complete Model Context Protocol including Resources, Prompts, and Tools with strict type safety.
- **High-Performance Rust Core:** Re-implement the low-level transport and JSON-RPC parsing in Rust (via Node-API) to minimize the overhead of calling thousands of small tools.
- **Unified Connection Pooler:** Intelligent management of MCP server lifecycles, with automatic hibernation of idle servers and "warm start" for frequently used tools.

## 2. Advanced Transports
- **Secure Remote Stdio (SSH):** Allow connecting to MCP servers running on remote machines over SSH tunnels as if they were local.
- **Browser-Native MCP:** A specialized transport that allows the client to talk to MCP servers running as browser extensions or within webworkers.
- **P2P Discovery Transport:** Use the Borg mesh to discover and connect to MCP servers hosted by other nodes in the swarm.

## 3. Reliability & Observability
- **Circuit Breakers for Flaky Tools:** Automatically detect and disable tools that crash or time out frequently, preventing them from hanging the agent session.
- **Automatic Argument Repair:** Use a small local LLM to "fix" invalid arguments sent to MCP tools before they are executed, reducing round-trips.
- **Real-time Traffic Inspector:** A low-level "wireshark-style" debugger to monitor every JSON-RPC packet moving between the agent and the MCP servers.

## 4. Ecosystem & DX
- **Client-side Middleware:** Support for "plugins" that can intercept and modify tool calls (e.g., for logging, safety filtering, or auto-documentation).
- **Auto-generated Mock Servers:** Automatically generate mock MCP servers from existing tool schemas to enable offline testing and development.
- **TypeScript Type Generator:** A tool that scans active MCP servers and generates a strictly-typed TypeScript SDK for use in other Borg packages.
