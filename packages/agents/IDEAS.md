# Ideas for Improvement: @borg/agents

Creative architectural shifts to evolve the "Brain" of the borg swarm.

## 1. Intelligence & Self-Optimization
- **Autonomous Local Fine-Tuning:** A background process that captures high-quality reasoning traces and automatically fine-tunes local small models (Gemma 3, Llama 4) to eventually replace expensive cloud API calls.
- **Dynamic Skill Distillation:** Agents that can analyze successful task outcomes and "distil" the core strategy into a reusable Skill definition for the wider swarm.
- **Adversarial Goal Analysis:** A specialized agent that constantly attempts to find flaws or security risks in the `Director`'s active goals before execution begins.

## 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Thought Diffusion Visualizer:** A real-time data stream for the dashboard that visualizes the "Council Debate" process as a moving graph of conflicting and converging ideas.
- **Elastic Swarm Scaling:** Automatically spawn more specialized subagents based on the detected complexity of a task (e.g., spawn a "Testing Squad" if code changes exceed a specific complexity threshold).
- **Cross-Node Agent Federation:** Allow an agent running on a local desktop to seamlessly delegate a subtask to an agent running on a high-performance remote server via the P2P mesh.

## 3. Interaction & Trust
- **Decentralized Council Consensus:** Use the Bobcoin ledger to record and verify critical Council decisions, creating a permanent, cryptographically signed audit trail of the project's evolution.
- **Operator-Agent "Pair Programming" Mode:** A high-fidelity interaction mode where the agent explains its reasoning step-by-step and pauses for human "vibes-based" confirmation on architectural choices.
- **Biometrically Authorized "Veto":** Deep integration with the mobile companion app to allow the human operator to veto high-risk agent actions via FaceID/TouchID.

## 4. Architectural Enhancements
- **Rust-Based Decision Engine:** Rewrite the core `Director` state machine and `Council` logic in Rust for sub-millisecond coordination and zero-overhead telemetry.
- **Actor-Model Implementation:** Refactor the agents into a strict actor-model architecture (possibly using Akka or a custom Rust framework) to ensure total isolation and crash resilience.
- **Unified Handoff Protocol:** A strictly-typed protocol for transferring context and "memories" between different model generations during long-running sessions.
