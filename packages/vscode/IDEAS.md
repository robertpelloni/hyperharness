# Ideas for Improvement: borg VS Code Extension

Ambitious features to evolve the VS Code extension into a high-intelligence "Agent Portal."

## 1. Deep IDE Integration
- **"Agent Lens" Code Annotations:** Provide real-time AI-generated annotations in the editor (via CodeLens or Decorations) showing agent confidence, past bug history, or "lessons learned" for the active function.
- **Native Test & Debug Integration:** Allow agents to directly interact with the VS Code Testing API and Debug Adapter Protocol to automatically run, fix, and verify tests.
- **Predictive Context Portal:** Automatically harvest and index code symbols as the human developer browses the codebase, ensuring the agent always has the most relevant local context.

## 2. Immersive Visuals & UX
- **Embedded Dashboard Webview:** A first-class, high-performance webview within VS Code that renders the full borg Mission Control dashboard without leaving the IDE.
- **Visual Branch Navigator:** A specialized view showing the relationship between active Maestro sessions, git worktrees, and their respective architectural goals.
- **Intelligent Prompt Composer:** A rich markdown editor with built-in model comparison and "thought preview" capabilities, integrated directly into the VS Code sidebar.

## 3. Collaborative Swarm Features
- **Shared Session Monitor:** Allow multiple developers working on the same project to see each other's active agent sessions and collective swarm progress in real-time.
- **Peer-to-Peer Fact Sync:** Securely sync learned facts and code symbols between multiple VS Code instances on the same local network via the borg mesh.
- **Agent-Human "Handoff" UX:** Standardized notifications and UI states for when an agent requires human "vibes-based" confirmation or architectural guidance.

## 4. Architectural Enhancements
- **WASM-Powered Intelligence:** Run low-latency local embedding models and token counters directly within the extension via WASM to minimize orchestrator round-trips.
- **Universal LSP Bridge:** Expose borg's internal knowledge graph and semantic search capabilities via the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for use by other IDE tools.
- **Hardened Token Security:** Deep integration with the VS Code SecretStorage API to manage provider credentials with hardware-level security (e.g., Windows Hello / Keychain).
