# Ideas for Improvement: @borg/ui

Ambitious visual and interaction ideas to evolve the Mission Control dashboard.

## 1. Immersive 3D & Spatial UI
- **3D "Neural Brain" Dashboard:** An interactive 3D knowledge graph (using Three.js or React Three Fiber) that visualizes the entire P2P mesh, showing live "pulses" as agents share facts and tools.
- **Spatial Memory Mapping:** A VR/AR ready view of the file system and codebase where architectural dependencies are represented as physical structures.
- **Live Swarm Visualization:** A "battle-map" style overview showing multiple autonomous agents moving through the directory structure in real-time.

## 2. Advanced Interaction Patterns
- **Temporal Rewind Debugging UI:** A specialized timeline view that allows the operator to "scrub" through past agent actions and see the exact state of the file system and memory at any point in time.
- **Visual Workflow Architect:** A low-code node-based editor (like Flowise or LangFlow) integrated directly into the dashboard to design complex multi-agent "Squads."
- **Keyboard-First Omnibar:** A Command-K interface that allows full control of all 60+ borg services without using the mouse.

## 3. Mobile & Edge Experience
- **Real-time Mobile Companion (Link to @borg/mobile):** Complete the wireframe for the React Native app, allowing remote monitoring, vetoing of agent actions, and quota management from a phone.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Evolution:** Full offline support for the dashboard, allowing the operator to browse captured knowledge and logs without a connection to the local orchestrator.
- **Biometric Action Veto:** Use FaceID/TouchID on the mobile companion to authorize high-risk agent actions (like `rm -rf` or large refactors).

## 4. Design System & Aesthetics
- **Dynamic "Assimilation" Themes:** UI themes that automatically shift colors based on the active agent's "personality" or status (e.g., pulsing red during a critical bug fix).
- **Embedded Terminal Evolution:** Replace the current terminal with a full xterm.js implementation that supports split panes, multiplexing, and direct interaction with background processes.
- **Accessibility Auto-Audit:** Built-in background agent that constantly audits the dashboard's accessibility (WCAG 2.1) and generates fixes for the UI code.
