## Feature Wishlist (The Assimilation Queue)

The following features MUST be EXTREMELY WELL IMPLEMENTED and EXTREMELY WELL REPRESENTED by the UI, CLI, TUI, and documentation, including UI labeling and tooltips:

### MCP Router / Aggregator
- Master MCP server that aggregates many MCP servers into one unified interface
- MCP session lifecycle: auto-start, restart, keep-alive, heartbeat, timeout
- Single-instance serving multiple clients without duplication
- Latency measurement and health monitoring per server
- Namespace grouping for servers and tools
- Enable/disable individual tools and servers
- MCP traffic inspection with real-time JSON-RPC viewer
- Tool call chaining and workflow composition
- TOON format for context-saving tool descriptions
- Code mode (tools as executable functions)
- Tool automatic renaming (minimize context tokens)
- Tool reranking (by relevance, frequency, semantic similarity)
- Tool semantic search / tool RAG
- Progressive tool disclosure (lazy loading)
- Context inspector (see what's in the context window)
- MCP directory with ratings and categories
- Automatic MCP install from npm/pip/GitHub
- Environment variable and secrets management per server
- MCP client config auto-detection and auto-writing
- Import/export MCP configs (JSON/JSONC)
- Auto-detect all MCP configs on system
- Save sets of configs, wipe all, set all to preset

### Memory System
- Short-term, medium-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, procedural memory
- Context pruning, session pruning, memory pruning, reranking
- Import/export sessions and memories
- Auto-detect existing sessions/memories
- Automatically add memories about specified topics
- Memory dashboard (like Supermemory console)
- Session summarization and compaction

### Code Intelligence
- Code execution sandbox (Docker/WASM)
- Code indexing and semantic understanding
- Semantic code search (vector + ripgrep hybrid)
- LSP server integration (TypeScript, Python, Rust)
- AST visualization (graph view)
- Code chunking strategies (fixed, semantic, code-aware)
- RAG pipeline: intake documents, OCR, summarize

### Agent Orchestration
- Supervisor, council, autopilot
- Multi-model debate and consensus
- Share context between models
- Multiple models pair programming
- Architect-implementer pattern
- Subagents with timeouts, multiple models
- Skills, skill conversion, skill improvement
- Prompt library, system prompts, templates, jailbreaks
- Personas and customizable agent behavior
- Subagent definitions and collections

### Provider & Billing
- Intelligent model selection based on credits/free tier/subscription
- Provider fallback chains (try all providers of Model X, then Model Y)
- Plan with model X, implement with model Y
- Usage, billing, dashboard, credits, API vs auth
- Track reset dates and quotas

### Browser Extension
- Store memory from browsing
- browser-use automation
- Console/debug log capture
- MCP SuperAssistant integration
- Connect MCP to browser chat interfaces

### Session & Cloud Management
- Manage cloud dev sessions (Jules, Devin, Codex)
- Manage local CLI sessions
- Connect dashboard to CLI sessions
- Multi-session dashboard

- Auto-start previous sessions
- Pause/resume all sessions
- Import/export cloud dev memory
- Transfer tasks between local and cloud
- Broadcast messages to all sessions
- Remote/mobile management
