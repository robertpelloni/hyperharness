Evolving the search and RAG layer from basic indexing into a high-intelligence "Semantic Awareness" service.

## 1. Multi-Modal & Deep Retrieval
- **Visual Code Search:** Implement the ability to search across screenshots, architecture diagrams, and UI wireframes using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) alongside source code.
- **Cross-Repo Symbol Graph:** Index and link code symbols across the entire local machine, allowing an agent working on `apps/web` to instantly find and understand a related utility in an unrelated project.
- **Natural Language "Code Miner":** A feature that allows the operator to ask complex questions about the codebase's history and intent (e.g., "Why did we switch from WebSockets to SSE in the dashboard?").

## 2. Intelligence & Predictive RAG
- **Real-Time "Context Pulse":** Continuously monitor active agent sessions and pre-fetch relevant code symbols or documentation before the agent even asks, reducing latency.
- **Automated RAG Evaluation:** A background process that constantly runs "retrieval tests" against known facts to measure and optimize the precision and recall of the search engine.
- **Semantic "Diff" Search:** Search not just for current code, but for *changes* in code over time, allowing agents to understand how an architectural pattern has evolved.

## 3. Decentralized & Swarm Search

- **P2P Knowledge Mesh Search:** Allow agents to securely query the captured knowledge and "observations" of other HyperCode nodes in the swarm via the P2P mesh.

- **Verified Fact Index:** A specialized index for facts that have been "verified" by the Council or a human operator, ensuring high-trust retrieval for critical tasks.
- **Privacy-Preserving Search:** Implement zero-knowledge proofs or differential privacy for swarm-wide search, allowing agents to benefit from collective knowledge without exposing sensitive local data.

## 4. Architectural Enhancements
- **Rust-Powered Vector Core:** Transition the low-level indexing and similarity calculations to a high-performance Rust core (possibly integrating with LanceDB or a custom HNSW implementation).
- **GPU-Accelerated Embedding:** Local GPU-based embedding generation to bypass API costs and latency for large-scale initial indexing of massive monorepos.
- **Plug-and-Play Index Adapters:** Support for hot-swapping different vector database backends (Chroma, Pinecone, local files) based on the project's scale and security needs.
