Ambitious features to evolve the tool orchestration and execution layer.

## 1. Tool-Chaining & Workflow Evolution
- **Visual "Chain Designer":** A drag-and-drop node-based editor in the dashboard to visually design and version complex `ChainExecutor` workflows.
- **Recursive Tool Discovery:** A tool that can scan an unfamiliar codebase, identify potential entry points, and automatically "generate" a specialized MCP server to interact with it.
- **Conditional Chain Branching:** Enhance the `ChainExecutor` to support sophisticated "if/else" logic and error-recovery branches based on the real-time output of previous tool calls.

## 2. Intelligence & Efficiency
- **Autonomous "Context Minimizer":** A background layer that automatically strips redundant whitespace, comments, and boilerplate from tool outputs to minimize token usage without losing information.
- **Predictive Argument Suggestions:** Analyze past successful tool calls to provide the agent with highly accurate "ghost" arguments for frequently used tools.
- **Tool-Specific Knowledge RAG:** Automatically inject relevant documentation or past "lessons learned" into the context window whenever a specific complex tool (e.g., `git_rebase`) is called.

## 3. Secure Execution & Interop
- **WASM "Universal Tool Bridge":** Allow execution of tools written in any language (Python, Go, Rust) by compiling them to WASM and running them within a unified, strictly-governed sandbox.
- **Kernel-Level Resource Limiting:** Enforce strict CPU, memory, and disk I/O limits for every tool call via integration with Linux cgroups or Windows Job Objects.
- **Cryptographically Signed Tool Output:** Every tool response should include a verifiable hash and signature to prevent "hallucinated" infrastructure states.

## 4. Systems & OS Integration
- **Direct GUI Control Wrapper:** A specialized toolset that allows agents to interact with non-CLI software (e.g., Figma, Slack, Browser DevTools) via OS-level accessibility APIs.
- **Unified Tunneling Gateway:** Built-in support for multiple tunneling providers (ngrok, Cloudflare, Tailscale) to allow agents to "expose" a local development server to the internet for testing.
- **"Ghost Browser" Multi-Context:** Enable the `BrowserTool` to maintain multiple isolated browser profiles simultaneously, allowing an agent to test interactions between different user roles.
