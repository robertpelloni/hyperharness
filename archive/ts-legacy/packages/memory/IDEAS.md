# Ideas for Improvement: @hypercode/memory

Ambitious features to evolve the "Long-Term Memory" and context persistence layer.

## 1. Decentralized & Swarm Memory
- **P2P Memory Swarm:** Allow multiple HyperCode nodes to securely share and "gossip" learned facts, code symbols, and architectural patterns via the P2P mesh.
- **Collective Intelligence Ledger:** A conceptual system where successful agent strategies are recorded on a global, verifiable ledger (Bobcoin integration) for all swarm members to benefit from.
- **Recursive Knowledge Harvesting:** Agents that can autonomously "read" and summarize entire libraries or documentation sites and store the resulting knowledge in the shared swarm memory.

## 2. Intelligence & Maintenance
- **Autonomous "Context Gardener":** A background process that periodically reviews the entire memory graph to prune redundant entries, merge related concepts, and identify "stale" information.
- **Semantic Forgetting:** Implement a "forgetting curve" algorithm that automatically archives or discards low-value or rarely accessed memories to prevent knowledge graph bloat.
- **Predictive Context Injection:** Analyze the current task and proactively inject the top 5 most relevant past "lessons learned" into the agent's context before it starts working.

## 3. Security & Trust
- **Biometrically Encrypted Memory:** Use the mobile companion app (FaceID/TouchID) to provide the decryption keys for sensitive memory clusters, ensuring agents can only access them when the operator is present.
- **Cryptographic Memory Attestation:** Every memory entry should include a "proof of origin," showing exactly which model session or tool call generated the information.
- **Differential Privacy for Mesh Sync:** Allow agents to contribute to the global swarm memory without exposing the specific source code or sensitive strings of the local project.

## 4. Architectural Enhancements
- **Rust-Powered Vector Engine:** Transition the low-level indexing and retrieval logic to a high-performance Rust core (possibly building upon LanceDB's native capabilities).
- **Temporal Memory Scrubbing:** A UI for the dashboard that allows the operator to "travel back in time" and see exactly what the agent's knowledge graph looked like at any specific point in the project's history.
- **Unified Schema for Multi-Modal Memory:** Support for storing and linking non-textual memories (e.g., UI screenshots, terminal PTY recordings, and audio logs) within the same semantic graph.
