# Ideas for Improvement: @hypercode/core

Ambitious architectural pivots and feature ideas for the "Central Nervous System" of HyperCode.

## 1. Architectural Evolution
- **Kernel-Level FS Watching:** Implement a specialized file system watcher (possibly via eBPF on Linux or a custom Windows driver) to capture file events with zero latency and bypass Node.js `fs.watch` limitations.
- **Micro-Kernel Rewrite:** Refactor the core into a minimal micro-kernel responsible only for message passing, with all services (MCP, RAG, Mesh) running as isolated, restartable processes.
- **Unified Event Bus (NATS/Redis):** Replace the internal EventEmitter with a high-performance, distributed event bus to allow multiple HyperCode instances to share real-time state across a local network or VPN.

## 2. Advanced Networking & Mesh
- **Decentralized P2P Knowledge Mesh:** Evolve the current mesh into a truly decentralized knowledge graph where nodes can discover and "gossip" learned facts and code symbols without a central registry.
- **mTLS by Default:** Enforce Mutual TLS for all internal and cross-node communication, with an autonomous internal Certificate Authority (CA) that rotates keys hourly.
- **Auto-Tunneling Gateway:** Built-in support for Cloudflare Tunnels or Tailscale to allow secure, one-click remote access to the local HyperCode orchestrator from the mobile app.

## 3. Intelligence & Self-Healing
- **Autonomous "HyperCode Implants":** A system of self-installing scripts that "implant" themselves into project build pipelines to capture telemetry and provide real-time suggestions during CI/CD.
- **Predictive Resource Pre-fetching:** Analyze the current coding session to predict which MCP tools or code symbols will be needed next, pre-loading them into memory before the agent asks.
- **Adversarial Security Auditor:** A background agent that constantly attempts to find vulnerabilities in the running MCP servers and automatically generates patches.

## 4. Systems Integration
- **Direct OS Control:** Deep integration with OS-level automation (AppleScript, Windows UI Automation) to allow agents to interact with non-CLI tools (e.g., Slack, Chrome, specialized IDEs).
- **Universal Tool Chaining:** A declarative language (JSON/YAML) to define complex tool workflows that HyperCode can execute as a single, atomic operation.
- **Hardened Sandbox Execution:** Run all MCP tools inside gVisor or Firecracker micro-VMs to ensure total isolation from the host system.
