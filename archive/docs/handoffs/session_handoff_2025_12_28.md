# hypercode Handoff - Session 2025-12-28

## Status Update
- **Core:** 
    - `ContextManager` now monitors file changes (using chokidar) and loads `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.
    - `ContextAnalyzer` (utility) has been implemented to parse message arrays and calculate token usage/percentages by type (system, user, tool, memory, code).
- **UI:**
    - `MemoryPage` has been completely refactored and moved to `packages/ui/components/MemoryPage.tsx`. It now supports:
        - Ingesting memories with tags.
        - Searching memories.
        - Listing and Restoring snapshots.
        - **New:** Viewing snapshot content in a modal before restoring.
    - `ContextPage` (`packages/ui/src/app/context/page.tsx`) has been created to visualize the current context window using `recharts` (Pie Chart + breakdown).
- **Submodules:**
    - All submodules have been updated to their latest remote versions (OpenAgents pulled from `develop`, others from `main`/`master`).
    - Dashboard regenerated.

## Next Steps
1. **Connect Context API:** The frontend `ContextPage` expects `/api/context/stats`. This route needs to be implemented in `packages/core/src/routes/` to call `ContextManager.getContextStats()` (which needs to be finalized to return the real data structure).
2. **Testing:** Run the full stack (`npm run dev`) and verify:
    - Memory ingestion/retrieval.
    - Snapshot restore.
    - Context visualization updates in real-time.
3. **Roadmap:** Continue with "Code Mode" implementation (sandbox integration) as per the roadmap.

## Known Issues
- None currently. Build passes.
