# Session Handoff: hypercode Core - Phase 3 Completion

**1. Current Status & Achievements (v0.2.11)**
We have successfully completed the **real-time Supervisor feedback loop**, integrating the Supervisor Plugin with the Core Socket.IO server and the Frontend UI.

*   **Supervisor Plugin:**
    *   Updated `packages/supervisor-plugin/src/index.ts` to accept a `Socket.IO` server instance.
    *   Implemented `log()` method to emit `supervisor:log` events.
    *   Implemented `executeTask()` with simulated phases (Planning, Execution, Verification) that emit `supervisor:status` updates.
*   **Core Integration:**
    *   Updated `packages/core/src/server.ts` to instantiate `SupervisorPlugin` and inject the `io` instance.
    *   Updated `packages/core/src/routes/supervisorRoutes.ts` to trigger `supervisor.executeTask()` in the background.
*   **Frontend UI:**
    *   Created `packages/ui/src/app/supervisor/page.tsx` with a real-time log viewer.
    *   Implemented `Socket.IO` client connection to listen for logs and status updates.
    *   Added a task input form to trigger the Supervisor.

**2. Key Files & Locations**
*   **Plugin Logic:** `packages/supervisor-plugin/src/index.ts`
*   **API Route:** `packages/core/src/routes/supervisorRoutes.ts`
*   **Server Setup:** `packages/core/src/server.ts`
*   **Frontend Page:** `packages/ui/src/app/supervisor/page.tsx`

**3. Verification**
*   Ran a verification script (`scripts/verify_supervisor.ts`) that successfully triggered a task via API and received all expected real-time logs and status updates via Socket.IO.
*   Core server starts successfully and mounts the new routes.

**4. Immediate Next Steps (Deployment Phase)**
1.  **Deployment:** Deploy the updated `@super-ai/core` and `@super-ai/ui` to the staging environment.
2.  **User Acceptance Testing:**
    *   Navigate to `/supervisor` in the deployed UI.
    *   Run a test task (e.g., "Optimize the database schema").
    *   Verify that the simulated logs appear in real-time.
3.  **Real Implementation:**
    *   Replace the *simulated* logic in `SupervisorPlugin.ts` with actual agent orchestration logic (using `AgentExecutor` or `Task` tool).
    *   Connect the Supervisor to the `AgentManager` to spawn real sub-agents.

**5. Known Issues / Notes**
*   The current Supervisor logic is a *simulation* (sleeps and mock logs). It needs to be connected to the actual LLM planning logic in the next phase.
*   The `core_log.txt` showed some unrelated errors regarding `MetaMcpClient` connection (Docker not running?), which should be investigated separately if using MCP features.
