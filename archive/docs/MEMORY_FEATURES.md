## Core Memory Architecture

### Memory Types
- [ ] **Working Memory**: Short-term, session-specific context
- [ ] **Factual Memory**: Persistent facts and preferences
- [ ] **Episodic Memory**: Specific interaction memories
- [ ] **Semantic Memory**: Conceptual understanding
- [ ] **Graph Memory**: Relationship-based storage

### Storage Backends
- [ ] Vector database (Chroma, pgvector, Qdrant)
- [ ] Graph database (Neo4j, etc.)
- [ ] Key-value store (Redis)
- [ ] SQLite for local caching
- [ ] Hybrid storage (vector + graph + KV)
