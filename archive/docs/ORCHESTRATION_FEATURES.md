## Maestro Specific Features

### Git Worktree Orchestration
- [ ] **Task Branches**: Each agent gets a dedicated git worktree
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: No file lock contention
- [ ] **Context Isolation**: Clean environment per sub-task
- [ ] **Auto-Merge**: Supervisor merges worktrees on completion

### Agent UX
- [ ] **Playbooks**: Defined sets of tasks
- [ ] **Group Chat**: Multi-agent chat interface

## Comparison: LangGraph vs CrewAI

| Feature | LangGraph | CrewAI |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Architecture | Graph-based | Role-based teams |
| State | Centralized shared | Per-agent + shared |
| Workflows | Nodes + edges | Flows + Crews |
| Memory | Working + persistent | Short/long/entity/contextual |
| Control | Explicit graph | Declarative roles |
| HITL | State inspection/modification | Task review + feedback |
| Best For | Complex workflows | Team collaboration |
