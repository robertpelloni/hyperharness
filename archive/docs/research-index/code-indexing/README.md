# Code Indexing

**Purpose**: Code understanding, AST analysis, semantic code search systems

## Overview

Code indexing systems provide deep understanding of codebases through parsing, AST analysis, and semantic search. This category tracks tools and frameworks for Hypercode's code understanding capabilities.

## Integration Strategy

1. **Add as submodules** for reference
2. **Study code parsing** and AST analysis
3. **Implement semantic code search** with embeddings
4. **Create code graph** visualization
5. **Add LSP integration** for real-time understanding
6. **Build code summarization** and documentation generation

## Hypercode Code Indexing Architecture

Hypercode should provide:
- **AST parsing**: Parse code to abstract syntax trees
- **Semantic search**: Find code by meaning, not just keywords
- **Code graph**: Visualize codebase dependencies
- **Symbol extraction**: Functions, classes, variables, imports
- **Code summarization**: Auto-generate documentation
- **Cross-references**: Find usage of symbols across files
- **Diff understanding**: Understand code changes semantically
- **Language support**: All major programming languages
- **Real-time indexing**: Update on file changes
- **LSP integration**: Use existing LSP servers
