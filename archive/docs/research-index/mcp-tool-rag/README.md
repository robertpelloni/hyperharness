# MCP Tool RAG / Disclosure

**Purpose**: Dynamic tool loading, semantic search, progressive disclosure for MCP tools

## Overview

MCP Tool RAG and disclosure systems reduce context usage by only exposing relevant tools to models at runtime. This category tracks implementations of semantic tool search, progressive tool disclosure, and MCP aggregation.

## Integration Strategy

1. **Add as submodules** for reference
2. **Study progressive disclosure algorithms**
3. **Extract semantic search implementations**
4. **Analyze tool chaining patterns**
5. **Implement tool RAG system** in Hypercode
6. **Build universal MCP router/aggregator**
7. **Add traffic inspection** and logging

---

## Hypercode Tool Disclosure Architecture

Hypercode should implement:
- **Semantic tool search**: Find relevant tools by query
- **Progressive disclosure**: Only expose N tools at a time
- **Tool RAG**: Vector embeddings of tool descriptions
- **Tool chaining**: Automatic composition of tools
- **Tool groups/namespaces**: Organize tools logically
- **Dynamic loading**: Load/unload tools on demand
- **Traffic inspection**: Monitor all MCP tool calls
- **Latency tracking**: Measure tool response times
- **Keep-alive system**: Prevent server timeouts
- **Master MCP config**: Universal configuration management
