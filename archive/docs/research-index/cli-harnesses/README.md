# CLI Harnesses

**Purpose**: Command-line AI coding tools (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codebuff, Codex, etc.)

## Overview

CLI harnesses are command-line tools that provide AI-powered coding capabilities. This category tracks all major CLI tools to achieve feature parity with Hypercode's own CLI/TUI/WebUI.

## Feature Parity Tracker

## Integration Strategy

1. **Add as submodules** for reference and code inspection
2. **Identify unique features** of each tool
3. **Extract reusable patterns** and utilities
4. **Create wrappers** where beneficial (direct code calls)
5. **Implement feature parity** for core functionality
6. **Migrate unique features** to Hypercode CLI

---

## Hypercode CLI Architecture

Hypercode CLI should provide:
- **Universal provider support** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, etc.)
- **Multi-model routing** with intelligent selection
- **Session management** with history and export/import
- **File operations** (read, write, edit, search)
- **Code execution** in sandboxed environments
- **LSP integration** for intelligent edits
- **Diff visualization** and streaming
- **TUI mode** for terminal interfaces
- **Web UI mode** for browser access
- **Mobile access** for remote control
- **Autopilot mode** for autonomous execution

---

## Research Tasks

- [ ] Document unique features of each CLI
- [ ] Extract common patterns (diff editing, file ops, etc.)
- [ ] Study provider integration approaches
- [ ] Analyze session management implementations
- [ ] Research TUI frameworks used
- [ ] Document mobile access patterns
- [ ] Create feature matrix comparison
- [ ] Implement missing features in Hypercode CLI
