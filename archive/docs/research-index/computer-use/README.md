# Computer Use / Browser

**Purpose**: Computer control, browser automation, screen interaction systems

## Overview

Computer-use and browser automation systems enable AI agents to interact with GUIs, web pages, and desktop applications. This category tracks frameworks and MCP servers for Hypercode's computer-use capabilities.

## Integration Strategy

1. **Add as submodules** for reference
2. **Study computer-use patterns** (screen capture, clicking, typing)
3. **Implement browser automation** using Playwright
4. **Add desktop control** for native apps
5. **Create computer-use MCP** as universal server
6. **Build visual feedback** system (screenshots, recordings)

## Hypercode Computer-Use Architecture

Hypercode should provide:
- **Browser automation**: Control Chrome/Firefox via Playwright
- **Desktop control**: Click, type, drag on screen elements
- **Screen capture**: Real-time screenshots for visual context
- **Video streaming**: Live screen feed for models
- **Element identification**: AI-powered UI element detection
- **Natural language actions**: "Click the blue button", "Open settings"
- **Browser extension**: Inject into web pages for direct control
- **Console access**: Read debug console for errors
- **History scraping**: Extract browsing history
- **Session recording**: Save computer-use sessions for review
