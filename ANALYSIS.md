# HyperCode Complete Parity & Stabilization Pass

## 1. Zero-Error Workspace Compilation
The entire HyperCode monorepo (`@hypercode/*`, `maestro`, `@jules/*`, `hypercode-extension`) has been successfully compiled using `pnpm run build:workspace` with **0 errors**.

## 2. Native Maestro Evolution
A new native application framework has been introduced in `apps/maestro-native` to achieve the goal of porting Maestro to C++/Qt6:
- Utilizes the `bobui` submodule framework.
- Standardized CMake build structure for cross-platform support.
- Bootstrapped the initial QML layout reflecting the Maestro split-pane view (Sidebar, Chat, Terminal).
- **Native Terminal Bridge**: Registered the `bobui` C++ `OmniTerminal` component natively to the QML engine, exposing the high-performance PTY backend directly to the UI layer for perfect feature parity.

## 3. Go Sidecar Integration
The experimental Go orchestrator (`apps/maestro-go`) has been significantly enhanced:
- **Wails Integration:** Integrated the Wails framework to bridge Go processes to the React frontend.
- **Process Management:** Implemented PTY/Stdio command execution and streaming natively in Go (`ExecuteCommand`, `KillProcess`).
- **Agent Detection:** Ported the PATH-based agent detection logic into the `agents` Go package.
- **MCP Aggregation Core:** Bootstrapped `mcp.Aggregator` in `go/internal/mcp` capable of maintaining persistent Stdio `Client` structs, tracking `jsonrpc` message IDs, and marshaling `tools/list` broadcasts locally.
- **Omniscient Memory Expansion:** Implemented a direct SQLite full-text search capability in `go/internal/memorystore/search.go`. The Go sidecar now falls back to native high-performance searches across `web_memories` and `imported_session_memories` when the primary Node router is unavailable, ensuring absolute read-parity.

## 4. Total Submodule Alignment
- All submodules, including `prism-mcp`, `hypercode`, `Maestro`, `OmniRoute`, and the `claude-mem` archives, have been synchronized.
- The `bobbybookmarks` submodule path and GitHub origin have been corrected.
- "Borg" nomenclature was eradicated across all nested submodules.

## 5. UI and Browser Parity Stabilization
- Fixed the `ThemeContext` broken import path in Maestro's Visual Orchestrator.
- Addressed missing React components in the HyperCode Dashboard (Tools and Logs pages).
- Upgraded the Maestro PWA UI capabilities and corrected missing React dependencies (`react-devtools-core` and `zustand`) within `@jules/cli`.
- **Browser Extension Parity**: Extensively refactored `hypercode-extension` background scripts to dynamically target the new HyperCode control plane (port 4000 and the correct WebSocket paths), removing legacy proxy routing (port 3006).

The "party" continues. All systems are deeply integrated, flawlessly compiling, and prepped for the next generation of native implementations.
