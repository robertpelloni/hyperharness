# HyperCode Stabilization Analysis — 2026-04-03

## Latest stabilization pass — startup/build recovery after rename drift

### Context
A live operator startup attempt via `start.bat` exposed a real regression in the TypeScript workspace after the large legacy-name → `hypercode` rename. The startup sequence did **not** require killing any process; it failed in build-time module resolution.

The most important signal from the operator log was:
- `@hypercode/core` failed to compile because several imports had already been renamed to `hypercode-*`, but the actual files still existed on disk under legacy filenames
- after fixing that layer, the next failure moved forward into `@hypercode/web` with the same root cause: renamed imports pointing at old legacy filenames
- `pnpm install` still emits a non-blocking `electron-rebuild` failure inside `apps/maestro` on Node 24 / Windows, but the startup wrapper continues past it and the workspace build is the decisive gate for this pass

### What was actually broken
#### 1. Core package rename drift
`packages/core` was importing:
- `../../lib/hypercode-orchestrator.js`
- `../config/HyperCodeConfig.js`
- `./hypercode.js`

But the real files on disk were still using legacy filenames for the orchestrator helper, its test, the config loader, and the council supervisor implementation.

This caused the exact startup build failure seen in the operator log.

#### 2. Web package rename drift
After fixing `@hypercode/core`, the workspace build correctly advanced and then failed in `apps/web` because imports expected:
- `apps/web/src/lib/hypercode-runtime.ts`
- `apps/web/src/components/HyperCodeOrchestratorWidget.tsx`

while the actual files still existed under legacy runtime/widget filenames.

This was another real post-rename mismatch, not a tooling false positive.

### What was changed
#### Core fixes
Renamed these files to match the imports the codebase already expected:
- legacy orchestrator helper → `packages/core/src/lib/hypercode-orchestrator.ts`
- legacy orchestrator helper test → `packages/core/src/lib/hypercode-orchestrator.test.ts`
- legacy config loader → `packages/core/src/config/HyperCodeConfig.ts`
- legacy council supervisor implementation → `packages/core/src/orchestrator/council/supervisors/hypercode.ts`

This was the smallest truthful fix because the source had already conceptually migrated to `hypercode` naming at the import layer.

#### Web fixes
Renamed these files to match the import graph:
- legacy runtime helper → `apps/web/src/lib/hypercode-runtime.ts`
- legacy orchestrator widget component → `apps/web/src/components/HyperCodeOrchestratorWidget.tsx`

#### Go entrypoint fix
A final path-level rename mismatch also existed in the Go tree:
- legacy Go entrypoint directory → `go/cmd/hypercode`

This mattered because the workspace analysis/documents and the new Go-primary startup tooling already treated `./cmd/hypercode` as the authoritative build target.

#### Go-primary startup build profile
Added a new startup-oriented build script:
- `scripts/build_startup.mjs`
- package script: `pnpm run build:startup-go`

Updated `start.bat` so that:
- `HYPERCODE_RUNTIME=auto` or `HYPERCODE_RUNTIME=go` defaults to a **Go-primary startup build**
- the Go-primary startup build validates:
  - `packages/cli`
  - `go/cmd/hypercode`
- full TS workspace build remains available when:
  - `HYPERCODE_RUNTIME=node`, or
  - `HYPERCODE_FULL_BUILD=1`
- optional web validation in Go-primary mode can be enabled with:
  - `HYPERCODE_STARTUP_BUILD_WEB=1`

Why this matters:
- it reduces startup dependence on the entire TypeScript workspace
- it better matches the Go-primary migration mandate
- it avoids making Go startup hostage to unrelated TS/UI build noise
- it keeps Node compatibility mode available explicitly instead of as the default validation burden

#### Go-primary install-skip probe
Added a startup dependency readiness probe:
- `scripts/check_startup_install.mjs`

Updated `start.bat` so that in `auto` / `go` runtime modes it now:
- checks whether the workspace already has the minimum Go-primary startup dependencies present
- skips `pnpm install` when those dependencies are already resolvable and the lock/modules state is in sync
- still performs `pnpm install` when the probe says install is required
- still allows a forced install with:
  - `HYPERCODE_FORCE_INSTALL=1`
- still allows a full manual skip with:
  - `HYPERCODE_SKIP_INSTALL=1`

What the probe currently verifies:
- `node_modules/.modules.yaml` exists
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is not newer than the modules state file
- `packages/cli` can resolve the dependencies needed for the Go-primary startup path
- the Go control-plane entrypoint exists at `go/cmd/hypercode/main.go`

Why this matters:
- it avoids rerunning a noisy workspace-wide install on every Go-primary startup attempt
- it reduces exposure to known non-blocking install-time failures like the Windows/Node 24 Maestro `electron-rebuild` issue when the workspace is already usable
- it makes Go-primary startup faster and more truthful without pretending Node compatibility surfaces are validated when they were intentionally skipped

#### Direct built-CLI startup handoff
Updated the final `start.bat` launch step so it now:
- launches `node packages/cli/dist/cli/src/index.js start` directly when the built CLI entrypoint exists
- only falls back to `pnpm start` if that built CLI entrypoint is missing
- forwards any extra command-line arguments through to the CLI entrypoint

Why this matters:
- it removes one more unnecessary package-manager hop from the Go-primary startup path
- it makes the actual launch phase match the already-validated built CLI artifact
- it reduces dependence on root script indirection after install/build decisions are already complete

#### Build-skip artifact freshness probe
Added a build artifact freshness probe:
- `scripts/check_startup_build.mjs`

Updated `start.bat` so that in Go-primary startup mode it now:
- checks whether the built CLI entrypoint is present and current relative to CLI source inputs
- checks whether the built Go control-plane binary is present and current relative to Go source inputs
- skips the Go-primary startup build when those artifacts are already current
- still runs the startup build when artifacts are missing or stale
- allows forcing the build with:
  - `HYPERCODE_FORCE_BUILD=1`

Current scope of artifact freshness checks:
- CLI inputs:
  - `packages/cli/src/**`
  - `packages/cli/package.json`
  - `packages/cli/tsconfig.json`
- CLI output:
  - `packages/cli/dist/cli/src/index.js`
- Go inputs:
  - `go/cmd/**`
  - `go/internal/**`
  - `go/go.mod`
  - `go/go.sum`
- Go output:
  - `go/hypercode(.exe)`

In the same pass, `start.bat` was updated to print explicit phase summaries:
- `Install phase summary: ...`
- `Build phase summary: ...`

Those summaries now make the operator-visible startup contract much clearer by saying whether a phase ran or was skipped and the reason behind that decision.

Why this matters:
- repeat Go-primary startup can now avoid both install and build when the workspace is already ready
- it reduces startup latency and TS coupling further without pretending stale artifacts are acceptable
- it moves repeat startup behavior closer to a real binary-first operational model
- it makes the startup decision path operator-visible instead of leaving it implicit in probe noise

#### Prebuilt Go binary runtime launch preference
Updated `packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts` so the Go runtime launcher now:
- prefers the already-built `go/hypercode(.exe)` binary when it exists
- falls back to `go run ./cmd/hypercode` only when the prebuilt binary is absent
- allows forcing source launch with:
  - `HYPERCODE_GO_USE_SOURCE=1`

Additionally, startup output now reports the runtime provenance explicitly:
- `Launch mode: prebuilt Go binary`
- `Launch mode: source fallback via go run`
- `Launch mode: Node compatibility runtime (explicit selection)`
- `Launch mode: Node compatibility runtime (Go fallback)`

The CLI also now emits a concise `Startup mode summary:` block describing actual surface availability for the chosen runtime. That summary intentionally distinguishes:
- Go dashboard support as compatibility-only
- Go `--no-mcp` flag behavior as not yet mapped 1:1
- Go supervisor/auto-drive startup flag semantics vs actual native API availability
- full Node compatibility runtime support for integrated dashboard/MCP/supervisor/auto-drive flags

In the same slice, startup provenance is now persisted into the local startup lock and surfaced by `hypercode status` when available. That persisted provenance includes:
- requested runtime
- active runtime
- launch mode
- dashboard mode
- install decision / reason
- build decision / reason

This makes the startup truthfulness durable instead of transient.

That provenance is now also exposed through the TypeScript control-plane startup snapshot (`startupStatus`). The `startupStatus` API payload now includes a top-level `startupMode` field carrying the same persisted provenance, and the dashboard startup status type has been updated accordingly.

In this follow-up slice, the dashboard startup-readiness section now renders a visible `Startup mode` block backed by that `startupMode` payload. The UI now shows:
- requested runtime / active runtime
- launch mode
- dashboard mode
- install decision + reason
- build decision + reason
- last updated relative timestamp when available

That same operator truth is now also propagated into additional dashboard surfaces:
- **Health** now includes a `Startup mode` card in its right-hand detail column
- **Integrations** now includes a top-level `Startup mode` card near its overview stats
- **System Overview** now includes a `Startup mode` card alongside its system status sections
- **MCP System** now includes a `Startup mode` card alongside its environment/startup checks
- **Orchestrator / Autopilot** now includes a `Startup mode` section inside the operator control plane itself, explicitly separating main-control-plane startup provenance from live orchestrator proxy reachability

This reduces the need to return to the dashboard home page just to recover runtime provenance.

This startup-provenance dashboard propagation cluster is now complete.

The Go-native `/api/runtime/status` surface now also exposes equivalent startup provenance by reading startup metadata from the main CLI lock first and falling back to the Go lock. That means the native backend is now self-describing for:
- requested runtime / active runtime
- launch mode
- dashboard mode
- install/build decisions
- provenance source (`main-lock` vs `go-lock`)

The web local-compat startup fallback has now also been updated to carry `startupMode` from the same local lock metadata when upstream TRPC startup telemetry is unavailable. That means the dashboard can still show real startup provenance during local fallback mode instead of dropping back to a provenance-blind placeholder startup object.

That fallback is now further upgraded to prefer the Go-native `/api/startup/status` and `/api/runtime/status` surfaces when the TypeScript `startupStatus` procedure is unavailable. In practice, that means the dashboard compatibility layer can now reuse native Go truth for:
- startup readiness / summary
- blocking reasons
- startup uptime
- startup provenance (`startupMode`)
- imported-session maintenance counts
- memory-store readiness details
- session-supervisor bridge readiness
- Go runtime version

This is materially better than the previous pure local-lock/local-config placeholder because the fallback now preserves a truthful native control-plane snapshot instead of only a best-effort static guess.

The same compat layer now also prefers the Go-native `/api/mcp/status` surface when the TypeScript `mcp.getStatus` procedure is unavailable. That improves the MCP/router truth consumed by runtime-heavy dashboard views because fallback mode can now preserve native Go/router-derived values for:
- MCP initialization state
- server count
- tool count
- connected count
- lifecycle mode flags (`lazySessionMode`, `singleActiveServerMode`)
- source/source-backed summary hints

Importantly, this was wired into both compat paths:
1. the legacy MCP dashboard bridge batches, and
2. the richer local dashboard fallback route

So the improvement reaches both older MCP page query shapes and the broader dashboard/system pages that still depend on `trpc.mcp.getStatus`.

That same shared route layer now also prefers the Go-native provider-routing read surfaces when the TypeScript billing procedures are unavailable:
- `/api/billing/provider-quotas`
- `/api/billing/fallback-chain`

This replaces the previous empty placeholder compat responses for:
- `billing.getProviderQuotas`
- `billing.getFallbackChain`

with truthful native Go provider-routing previews. In practice that means dashboard fallback mode can now preserve:
- configured/authenticated provider inventory
- auth method / availability hints
- quota preview rows
- fallback-chain provider/model ordering
- task-type-aware fallback-chain previews

Again, this lands in both compat paths:
1. the legacy MCP dashboard bridge batches, and
2. the richer local dashboard fallback route

So the dashboard home and any other provider-summary surfaces no longer have to collapse to empty quota/fallback state just because the TypeScript billing router is unavailable.

The next adjacent shared improvement in that same compat layer is now `tools.detectCliHarnesses`. Instead of returning `[]` during degraded mode, the local dashboard fallback now prefers the Go-native `/api/cli/harnesses` inventory and normalizes it into the existing dashboard detection shape. That means degraded-mode Integrations / AI Tools surfaces can now keep a truthful harness roster for:
- total harness count
- installed harness count
- harness ids/names
- launch-command hints
- source-backed vs metadata-backed reality (via normalized install hints)
- primary HyperCode harness visibility

This is intentionally narrower than a full execution-environment replacement: it upgrades the harness inventory first without over-claiming that the entire `tools.detectExecutionEnvironment` surface is Go-native yet.

The next adjacent shared improvement is `session.list`. Instead of returning `[]` during degraded mode, both compat paths now prefer the Go-native `/api/sessions` inventory and normalize those discovered sessions into the existing dashboard/session-page row shape. That means degraded-mode operator views can now retain truthful native session visibility for:
- session ids
- cli type
- current status (mapped truthfully from native states such as `active` → `running`)
- task/title
- source-path-backed working directory field
- started/last-activity timing
- detected model hints when present

This still does not claim full Go-native supervised-session parity; it is specifically a read-surface improvement so dashboards stop collapsing to empty session inventories when the TypeScript session list is unavailable.

The adjacent session-management gap was `session.catalog`. There is no direct Go-native `session.catalog` endpoint, but the Go harness inventory already exposes enough truthful metadata to derive a safe degraded-mode session catalog. The compat layer now maps Go `/api/cli/harnesses` into the session catalog shape so the session dashboard can still offer a realistic harness selector with:
- harness id / name
- command hints
- install status
- install guidance
- resolved path when known
- version label
- `sessionCapable` truthy entries
- stable `category: 'cli'` fallback

This is intentionally framed as a derived catalog fallback, not as proof that the TypeScript session harness catalog runtime has been fully ported.

The next broader degraded-mode gap was `tools.detectExecutionEnvironment`. Unlike `session.catalog`, this one already had a real Go-native truth source: `/api/tools/detect-execution-environment` bridges the TypeScript router when available and falls back to native Go shell/tool/harness detection when the router is unavailable. The web compat layer simply was not using it yet. That is now fixed. The local dashboard compat path now:
- prefers Go-native execution-environment truth for `tools.detectExecutionEnvironment`
- normalizes native shell rows into the existing dashboard contract (`id`, `name`, `installed`, `verified`, `preferred`, `resolvedPath`, `family`, `version`)
- normalizes native tool rows into the existing dashboard contract (`id`, `name`, `installed`, `verified`, `resolvedPath`, `version`, `capabilities`)
- preserves native execution summary fields such as preferred shell, verified shell/tool counts, harness counts, PowerShell/POSIX support, and operator notes
- reuses the same normalized summary to populate `startupStatus.checks.executionEnvironment` during degraded-mode fallback, so dashboard home/system summaries stop drifting away from the AI Tools page

When the execution-environment endpoint is itself unavailable, the compat layer now still preserves truthful harness counts from the already-upgraded Go harness inventory instead of collapsing the entire execution-environment shape back to all-zero synthetic placeholders.

The next adjacent degraded-mode gap was `tools.detectInstallSurfaces`. This was a close cousin of the execution-environment problem: the Go side already had a truthful `/api/tools/detect-install-surfaces` surface, but the web compat layer still returned `[]`. That is now fixed too. The local dashboard compat path now:
- prefers Go-native install-surface truth for `tools.detectInstallSurfaces`
- preserves the existing install-artifact summary contract used by Integrations, Health, MCP System, Dashboard Home, and the Claude Mem parity page
- normalizes native artifact rows into `id`, `status`, `artifactPath`, `artifactKind`, `detail`, `declaredVersion`, and `lastModifiedAt`
- keeps the existing UI semantics intact for `ready` vs `partial` vs `missing` artifacts, so operator actions like load-unpacked/install-VSIX/sync-dashboard guidance continue to work without page-level rewrites

This means degraded-mode install surfaces no longer collapse to empty arrays when the TypeScript detector is unavailable, and browser-extension / VS Code / MCP client sync setup pages can keep showing truthful artifact presence and freshness data from the native Go path.

After that, the remaining adjacent gap was imported-session maintenance reads that bypass the already-upgraded startup-status path. There was no active direct web consumer at the time of this slice, but the shared compat layer still had a hole: if a page started using `session.importedMaintenanceStats`, it would not inherit the same native truth that the Go control plane already exposed via `/api/sessions/imported/maintenance-stats`. That is now fixed. The local dashboard compat path now:
- prefers Go-native `/api/sessions/imported/maintenance-stats` for `session.importedMaintenanceStats`
- preserves the existing maintenance contract (`totalSessions`, `inlineTranscriptCount`, `archivedTranscriptCount`, `missingRetentionSummaryCount`)
- backfills degraded `startupStatus.checks.importedSessions` from that same native maintenance endpoint when `/api/startup/status` does not already provide imported-session telemetry

That keeps direct imported-session maintenance queries truthful for future consumers and also prevents system/dashboard startup summaries from dropping imported-session archive telemetry just because the startup endpoint is temporarily unavailable while the dedicated maintenance endpoint still works.

The next highest-value runtime-heavy `tools.*`-adjacent gap was the MCP Inspector cluster: `mcp.getWorkingSet`, `mcp.getToolSelectionTelemetry`, and `mcp.getToolPreferences`. Those queries already had truthful Go/native sources (`/api/mcp/working-set`, `/api/mcp/tool-selection-telemetry`, `/api/mcp/preferences`), but the web compat layer still returned synthetic placeholders. That is now fixed. The local dashboard compat path now:
- prefers Go-native MCP working-set state for `mcp.getWorkingSet`
- prefers Go-native/local MCP tool-selection telemetry for `mcp.getToolSelectionTelemetry`
- prefers Go-native/local MCP tool preferences for `mcp.getToolPreferences`
- normalizes working-set rows into the inspector contract (`name`, `hydrated`, `lastLoadedAt`, `lastHydratedAt`, `lastAccessedAt`)
- preserves limit fields used by the inspector (`maxLoadedTools`, `maxHydratedSchemas`, `idleEvictionThresholdMs`)
- preserves telemetry fields used by the inspector timeline/leaderboard/filters, including query/source/top-result/ignored-result/auto-load metadata
- preserves tool preference fields used by the inspector controls (`importantTools`, `alwaysLoadedTools`, `autoLoadMinConfidence`, `maxLoadedTools`, `maxHydratedSchemas`, `idleEvictionThresholdMs`)

This means degraded MCP inspector pages no longer collapse to empty working-set/telemetry/preference placeholders even though the Go MCP layer already had live local state available.

The next remaining operator-read placeholder cluster was `apiKeys.list`, `shell.getSystemHistory`, `agentMemory.stats`, and `expert.getStatus`. Those now also prefer existing Go/native truth instead of local placeholders:
- `apiKeys.list` now prefers Go-native `/api/api-keys`, deriving `key_prefix` from raw key material when only the local `key` field is present
- `shell.getSystemHistory` now prefers Go-native `/api/shell/history/system`, preserving the current `string[]` shell-history contract used by existing TS consumers
- `agentMemory.stats` now prefers Go-native `/api/memory/agent-stats`, normalizing native totals into the compact `session` / `working` / `longTerm` / `total` shape used by dashboard widgets
- `expert.getStatus` now prefers Go-native `/api/expert/status`, preserving truthful offline-state fallback instead of synthetic `{}`

This closes the remaining obvious operator-facing synthetic read placeholders in the shared compat layer for the AI Tools page, API Keys page, Shell History widget/tools page, Context Health widget, and Experts dashboard.

Why this matters:
- it makes Go-primary launch use the same compiled artifact that the startup build profile already validates
- it reduces repeated `go run` compilation overhead at runtime
- it moves the actual control-plane launch path closer to a real production-style Go-primary binary handoff
- it makes the runtime choice operator-visible instead of implicit
- it makes post-launch surface availability explicit instead of forcing operators to infer it from scattered warnings
- it makes startup decisions queryable through `hypercode status` instead of leaving them in terminal scrollback only
- it makes the same startup truth available to dashboard/API consumers rather than restricting it to the CLI
- it makes the dashboard itself reflect the real startup/runtime contract rather than only the server/CLI layers
- it makes the Go-native backend itself report that startup truth without depending on the TypeScript startup snapshot layer
- it reduces the chance that local dashboard fallback mode hides real startup/runtime provenance when the TS layer is unavailable

#### Lockfile hygiene
- The refreshed `pnpm-lock.yaml` no longer contains legacy-name references for the main workspace packages.

### Validation performed for this pass
#### Targeted package validation
```bash
pnpm -C packages/core run build
pnpm -C apps/web run build
```

Results:
- `@hypercode/core` build passed after the rename-alignment fixes
- `@hypercode/web` build passed after the runtime/widget rename-alignment fixes

#### Go-primary startup validation
```bash
pnpm -C packages/cli exec vitest run src/commands/start.test.ts
pnpm -C packages/cli run build
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
node scripts/build_startup.mjs --profile=go-primary
node scripts/check_startup_install.mjs --profile=go-primary
node scripts/check_startup_build.mjs --profile=go-primary
node packages/cli/dist/cli/src/index.js start --help
powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "cmd /c 'call start.bat --help'"
```

Results:
- CLI start-command regression tests passed
- CLI status-command regression tests passed
- core startup-status router regression tests passed
- Go runtime-status endpoint regression tests passed
- CLI build passed
- core build passed
- web build passed
- Go control-plane build passed
- new Go-primary startup build profile passed
- install-skip readiness probe correctly reported the current workspace as already ready for Go-primary startup
- build-skip artifact freshness probe correctly reported the current workspace artifacts as already current for Go-primary startup
- direct built-CLI launch path resolved and printed `hypercode start --help` successfully
- runtime provenance helper coverage passed in the CLI regression suite
- startup mode summary helper coverage passed in the CLI regression suite
- persisted startup-provenance status coverage passed in the CLI regression suite
- startupStatus snapshot coverage now also verifies persisted startup provenance propagation through the server/API-visible status payload
- Go-native runtime status coverage now also verifies startup provenance propagation through `/api/runtime/status`
- web build/type-check passed with the new dashboard `startupMode` rendering, the new Health / Integrations / System / MCP System / Orchestrator startup-mode surfaces, and the Go-enriched local-compat startup/MCP/provider/CLI-harness/session/session-catalog fallback paths
- a focused dashboard render test was added, but `vitest` is not directly installed in `apps/web`, so that new test was validated indirectly through the successful web build rather than executed as a standalone test command in this pass
- a focused app-route compat regression was executed successfully through the root Vitest runner (`pnpm exec vitest run apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.test.ts`), validating Go-native `/api/startup/status` + `/api/runtime/status` preference when `startupStatus` is unavailable, Go-native `/api/mcp/status` preference when `mcp.getStatus` is unavailable, Go-native provider quota/fallback-chain preference when TypeScript billing procedures are unavailable, Go-native `/api/cli/harnesses` preference when `tools.detectCliHarnesses` is unavailable, Go-native `/api/sessions` preference when `session.list` is unavailable, and Go-derived `session.catalog` fallback from the native harness inventory
- startup truthfulness validation also reproduced the exact operator path from `start.bat` without launching a long-lived process by using `start.bat --help`; after the fix, Go-primary startup now truthfully reports and executes the build when `scripts/check_startup_build.mjs` returns non-zero, and forced Go-primary installs now use `pnpm install --ignore-scripts` by default instead of tripping unrelated Maestro/Electron postinstall rebuilds
- the execution-environment + install-surface + imported-maintenance + MCP-inspector + operator-read compat slice was validated with:
  - `pnpm exec vitest run apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.test.ts`
  - `pnpm -C apps/web run build`
  - the route regression now proves Go-native `/api/tools/detect-execution-environment` preference for `tools.detectExecutionEnvironment`, verifies that the same normalized summary is injected into degraded `startupStatus.checks.executionEnvironment`, validates Go-native `/api/tools/detect-install-surfaces` preference for `tools.detectInstallSurfaces`, validates both direct `session.importedMaintenanceStats` fallback plus degraded `startupStatus.checks.importedSessions` backfill from `/api/sessions/imported/maintenance-stats`, validates Go-native MCP inspector preference for `mcp.getWorkingSet`, `mcp.getToolSelectionTelemetry`, and `mcp.getToolPreferences`, and validates Go-native preference for `apiKeys.list`, `shell.getSystemHistory`, `agentMemory.stats`, and `expert.getStatus`
- concrete validation for the startup slice included:
  - `pnpm -C packages/cli run build`
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command '$env:HYPERCODE_FORCE_INSTALL="1"; $env:HYPERCODE_SKIP_NATIVE_PREFLIGHT="1"; $env:HYPERCODE_SKIP_BUILD="1"; cmd.exe /c "start.bat --help"'`
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command '$env:HYPERCODE_SKIP_INSTALL="1"; cmd.exe /c "start.bat --help"'` (this exercised the corrected build-required path; native preflight still ran because the PowerShell env assignment was malformed on the first attempt, which is now documented truthfully rather than hidden)
  - `node scripts/check_startup_build.mjs`
- Health / Integrations / System / MCP System / Orchestrator runtime-provenance propagation and the upgraded compat fallback were validated through the successful `apps/web` production build and the focused route regression
- a short-lived `start.bat --help` run also completed and showed the new install/build phase summary lines before exiting through CLI help output

Validation boundary:
- no long-running Hub/runtime session was intentionally launched in this pass
- the batch-script help run exercised startup decisions and exited through CLI help rather than serving the control plane
- the PowerShell wrapper attempt to inject `HYPERCODE_SKIP_NATIVE_PREFLIGHT=1` was syntactically imperfect, so native preflight still ran during that specific batch help validation; this was observed and documented rather than hidden

#### Full workspace validation
```bash
pnpm run build:workspace
```

Result:
- succeeded end-to-end
- all 24 workspace build tasks completed successfully

### Important truthfulness notes
#### Stable in this pass
- the previously failing startup build blockers in `@hypercode/core` and `@hypercode/web` are fixed
- `pnpm run build:workspace` now succeeds again
- the new Go-primary startup build path succeeds
- the new install-skip readiness probe succeeds for the current workspace state
- the new build-skip artifact freshness probe succeeds for the current workspace state
- the direct built-CLI launch path succeeds
- the CLI Go runtime launcher now prefers the prebuilt Go binary when available
- startup output now truthfully reports runtime provenance for Go and Node compatibility paths
- startup output now truthfully reports whether install/build phases ran or were skipped and why
- startup output now also provides a concise startup-mode surface summary for the selected runtime
- startup provenance is now persisted into the local startup lock and exposed by `hypercode status` when available
- the TypeScript `startupStatus` API surface now also exposes that persisted startup provenance to dashboard/API consumers
- the dashboard startup-readiness section now visibly renders the persisted startup mode block instead of leaving the new payload hidden
- the Health, Integrations, System, MCP System, and Orchestrator dashboard pages now also visibly render startup/runtime provenance instead of limiting it to the home dashboard
- the web local-compat startup fallback now also carries `startupMode` from the local lock when upstream startup telemetry is unavailable
- that same web compat fallback now also prefers Go-native `/api/startup/status` and `/api/runtime/status` when the TypeScript `startupStatus` procedure is unavailable, reducing reliance on placeholder local lock/config guesses
- the web compat fallback and legacy MCP bridge now also prefer Go-native `/api/mcp/status` when the TypeScript `mcp.getStatus` procedure is unavailable, reducing reliance on placeholder local server-count guesses for MCP/router state
- the web compat fallback and legacy bridge now also prefer Go-native `/api/billing/provider-quotas` and `/api/billing/fallback-chain` when the TypeScript billing procedures are unavailable, reducing reliance on empty provider/fallback placeholders in degraded mode
- the web compat fallback now also prefers Go-native `/api/cli/harnesses` when `tools.detectCliHarnesses` is unavailable, reducing reliance on empty harness-detection placeholders in degraded mode
- the web compat fallback and legacy bridge now also prefer Go-native `/api/sessions` when `session.list` is unavailable, reducing reliance on empty session-list placeholders in degraded mode
- the web compat fallback now also derives `session.catalog` from Go-native `/api/cli/harnesses` when the TypeScript catalog is unavailable, reducing reliance on empty session-harness catalog placeholders in degraded mode
- `start.bat` no longer captures startup probe exit codes with parse-time `%ERRORLEVEL%` inside parenthesized blocks; it now uses runtime `!ERRORLEVEL!`, fixing a real contradiction where startup could print `Go-primary startup build is required` and then incorrectly claim `Skipping startup build because Go-primary build artifacts already current`
- Go-primary startup installs now default to `pnpm install --ignore-scripts` (unless `HYPERCODE_STARTUP_INSTALL_SCRIPTS=1` is set), reducing unnecessary coupling to unrelated workspace postinstall hooks such as Maestro/Electron rebuilds while still allowing the operator to force the full scripted install path when needed
- the web compat fallback now also prefers Go-native `/api/tools/detect-execution-environment` when `tools.detectExecutionEnvironment` is unavailable, and reuses that same normalized summary inside degraded `startupStatus.checks.executionEnvironment`
- the web compat fallback now also prefers Go-native `/api/tools/detect-install-surfaces` when `tools.detectInstallSurfaces` is unavailable, reducing reliance on empty install-artifact placeholders in degraded mode
- the web compat fallback now also prefers Go-native `/api/sessions/imported/maintenance-stats` when `session.importedMaintenanceStats` is unavailable, and uses that same maintenance data to backfill degraded `startupStatus.checks.importedSessions` when startup telemetry is incomplete
- the web compat fallback now also prefers Go-native MCP inspector state for `mcp.getWorkingSet`, `mcp.getToolSelectionTelemetry`, and `mcp.getToolPreferences`, reducing reliance on synthetic empty working-set, telemetry, and preference placeholders in degraded mode
- the web compat fallback now also prefers Go-native `/api/api-keys`, `/api/shell/history/system`, `/api/memory/agent-stats`, and `/api/expert/status` for `apiKeys.list`, `shell.getSystemHistory`, `agentMemory.stats`, and `expert.getStatus`, reducing reliance on synthetic empty operator-read placeholders in degraded mode
- the Go-native `/api/runtime/status` surface now also exposes startup provenance, making the native backend itself self-describing
- `start.bat` now validates Go-first startup surfaces by default for `auto`/`go` runtime modes instead of always requiring a full workspace build first
- `start.bat` can now skip `pnpm install` in Go-primary mode when the workspace is already ready
- `start.bat` can now also skip the Go-primary startup build when the built CLI and Go binary artifacts are already current
- `start.bat` now launches directly through the built CLI when available instead of depending on `pnpm start` for the final handoff
- the main monorepo (excluding archived content and external harness submodules) no longer contains textual legacy-name references
- the targeted startup-provenance dashboard propagation cluster is now complete, so the next step is shifting more runtime-heavy dashboard/system reads away from TS compatibility surfaces and onto Go-native status where equivalent native truth already exists

#### Still non-blocking / still present
- `apps/maestro` postinstall still reports an `electron-rebuild` failure under Node 24 on Windows during install
- in this workspace, that failure is currently **non-blocking** for the startup wrapper because the wrapper can continue into prerequisite checks and build validation, and in Go-primary mode can now often skip install entirely when the workspace is already ready
- Maestro production builds themselves completed successfully during this pass despite that install-time warning/failure

#### Still outside the main workspace boundary
A repo-wide legacy-name search still finds many references inside:
- `submodules/hyperharness`
- `submodules/superai`
- archived/vendor content under `archive/`
- binary/generated artifacts

Those are real findings. They were **not** normalized in this pass because:
- `hyperharness` and `superai` are separate competing harness upstreams with their own histories and internal naming
- archive/vendor content is not the operator-facing workspace runtime surface

So the truthful statement is:
- **main workspace runtime surface:** clean of legacy-name references after this pass
- **entire repo including external submodules/archive:** still contains legacy-name references and would require a separate dedicated cleanup effort

## Summary
This pass focused on **stabilization-first Go sidecar expansion** and a small **Maestro terminal-history UX fix**. The work stayed aligned with the current repo policy in `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: improve operator-facing reliability and truthful fallback behavior before speculative platform expansion.

## Truthfulness labels

### Stable
- `go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode` currently succeeds.
- `pnpm run build:workspace` currently succeeds across the workspace.
- The new Go code added in this pass compiles and is wired into the Go HTTP server.
- The Maestro quick action change for clearing terminal history builds successfully as part of the workspace build.

### Beta
- The Go sidecar now exposes additional native fallback surfaces for:
  - provider auto-routing improvements
  - native workflow execution endpoints
  - native supervisor endpoints
  - native session export
  - native git submodule update orchestration
- These surfaces compile and are route-registered, but they are still young and should be treated as beta until exercised with targeted API-level tests.

### Experimental
- The native workflow engine is a lightweight DAG executor with shell-command steps. It is useful and functional, but it is not yet a full parity replacement for every workflow feature exposed by the TypeScript side.
- The native supervisor HTTP surface is functional for create/start/stop/list/status flows, but it does not yet provide the same breadth of logs/streaming/inspection semantics as the mature TS path.
- The native session export path works as a file-based exporter and manifest writer, but it is not yet a comprehensive parity layer for every external session ecosystem.
- Concurrent native git submodule updating is implemented, but it should be considered experimental because some submodule remotes in this repo are known to be brittle or unavailable.

### Vision / still blocked
- `apps/maestro-native` Qt/Wails-adjacent native ambitions remain partially blocked by the external `bobui` toolchain state, especially missing generated Qt build tooling like `moc.exe` in the current local setup.
- Full Go parity for all TypeScript orchestration surfaces is still an ongoing migration, not a completed state.

## Work completed in this pass

### 1. Go provider routing expansion
File: `go/internal/ai/llm.go`

Added broader native provider coverage and better fallback selection logic.

#### Implemented
- Added `GeminiProvider` using Google Generative Language API.
- Added `DeepSeekProvider` using an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Added `OpenRouterProvider` using an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Added `ProviderPriority` routing order with env-var-driven selection.
- Added `AutoRouteWithModel()` for model override support.
- Added `ListConfiguredProviders()` to inspect configured native providers.

#### Result
The Go sidecar is no longer limited to just Anthropic/OpenAI for native fallback routing. It can now truthfully attempt a broader set of providers when the TS control plane is unavailable.

#### Status
**Beta** — compiled and integrated, but not yet validated with live API calls in this pass.

---

### 2. Native workflow engine
Files:
- `go/internal/workflow/engine.go`
- `go/internal/workflow/builtins.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/workflow_handlers.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`

Implemented a lightweight native Go workflow system.

#### Implemented
- DAG-style workflow model with:
  - step dependency resolution
  - topological sorting
  - step status tracking
  - concurrent execution where dependency structure allows it
  - output passing between dependent steps
- Built-in workflows:
  - `full-build`
  - `submodule-sync`
  - `lint-test`
- New native endpoints:
  - `/api/workflows/native`
  - `/api/workflows/native/get`
  - `/api/workflows/native/run`
  - `/api/workflows/native/create`

#### Important truthfulness note
This is **not** a complete replacement for every existing TypeScript workflow surface. It is a native fallback executor for practical shell-based workflows.

#### Status
**Experimental** — compiles, route-registered, suitable for iterative expansion.

---

### 3. Native supervisor API wiring
Files:
- `go/internal/httpapi/native_supervisor_handlers.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`

Connected the existing Go supervisor manager to first-class HTTP endpoints.

#### Implemented
- Native endpoints:
  - `/api/supervisor/native/list`
  - `/api/supervisor/native/create`
  - `/api/supervisor/native/start`
  - `/api/supervisor/native/stop`
  - `/api/supervisor/native/status`
- Server boot now initializes:
  - `supervisorManager`
  - `workflowEngine`

#### Result
The supervisor code is no longer just a library surface; it is now reachable through HTTP in the sidecar.

#### Status
**Beta** — compiles and is usable, but still narrower than the TS session/supervisor ecosystem.

---

### 4. Native session export
Files:
- `go/internal/sessionimport/exporter.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/session_export_handlers.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`

Expanded the exporter from a manifest stub into a practical file export flow.

#### Implemented
- Added file-based export logic that:
  - scans session candidates
  - copies source content into an export directory
  - records metadata per exported item
  - writes `export-manifest.json`
- Added native endpoint:
  - `/api/import/export-native`

#### Important truthfulness note
This exporter currently acts as a practical filesystem export/packaging path. It should not be described as universal parity for every import/export format.

#### Status
**Beta** — compiled and integrated.

---

### 5. Native git submodule orchestration fallback
Files:
- `go/internal/git/submodules.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/git_handlers.go`

Added a native Go path for `submodule.updateAll` fallback behavior.

#### Implemented
- `ListSubmodules()` parses `git submodule status`
- `UpdateAll()`:
  - initializes submodules recursively
  - updates submodules concurrently
  - captures per-submodule result status/output
- HTTP fallback handler attempts upstream first, then executes native Go orchestration if upstream is unavailable.

#### Important truthfulness note
This is especially useful in this repo because some submodules are known to have remote inconsistencies. The code handles that with per-submodule reporting, but the surrounding ecosystem is still operationally fragile.

#### Status
**Experimental** — good fallback utility, but needs targeted runtime exercise against real remote states.

---

### 6. Maestro terminal history clear action improvement
File:
- `apps/maestro/src/renderer/components/QuickActionsModal.tsx`

#### Implemented
Updated the “Clear Terminal History” quick action so it now clears:
- legacy `shellLogs`
- terminal-tab logs when terminal tabs exist

#### Why this matters
The previous behavior only cleared the legacy log array, which could leave visible terminal-tab history intact and create confusing UX.

#### Status
**Stable** for the changed behavior within current build validation.

---

## Validation performed

### 1. Go validation
Command:
```bash
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
```

Result:
- **Succeeded** with no reported compile errors after final fixes.

### 2. Workspace validation
Command:
```bash
pnpm run build:workspace
```

Result:
- **Succeeded**.
- Workspace build completed successfully.

### 3. Notable warnings still present during workspace build
These are warnings, not blockers, but they should be kept visible:
- `apps/cloud-orchestrator` warns that `pnpm.overrides` is defined below workspace root and will not take effect there.
- Maestro Vite/browser build logs include existing warnings around:
  - browser externalization of `crypto`
  - large chunk sizes
  - some dynamic/static import overlap
  - CSS minification warning around malformed CSS content already present elsewhere

These warnings predated this pass’s Go work and did **not** block successful builds.

---

## Files added or changed in this pass

### Added
- `go/internal/git/submodules.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/git_handlers.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/native_supervisor_handlers.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/session_export_handlers.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/workflow_handlers.go`
- `go/internal/workflow/engine.go`
- `go/internal/workflow/builtins.go`

### Modified
- `go/internal/ai/llm.go`
- `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
- `go/internal/sessionimport/exporter.go`
- `apps/maestro/src/renderer/components/QuickActionsModal.tsx`
- `ANALYSIS.md`

---

## Remaining gaps / next recommended steps

### Recommended next
1. Add targeted API-level tests for the new native Go endpoints:
   - workflows
   - supervisor native routes
   - export-native
   - submodule update fallback
2. Add structured logging around workflow execution and supervisor lifecycle events.
3. Add cancellation and safer execution constraints for native workflow shell steps.
4. Improve provider routing observability so the dashboard can show which native provider path was selected and why.
5. Normalize submodule path/base extraction for Windows path edge cases if needed.
6. Continue Maestro migration away from legacy `shellLogs`; current code still intentionally retains compatibility fallbacks for sessions without terminal tabs.

### Still blocked / external dependency
- `bobui` / Qt native toolchain completion is still required before claiming successful native Qt binary compilation for `apps/maestro-native`.

---

## Follow-up stabilization pass — native endpoint regression coverage
After shipping the native workflow/supervisor/export surfaces, a follow-up pass focused on **regression coverage** and one important lifecycle fix.

### Additional fixes
- `go/internal/httpapi/workflow_handlers.go`
  - `handleNativeWorkflowRun` now detaches from the request context using `context.WithoutCancel(...)` before launching asynchronous workflow execution.
  - This fixes a real stability issue where the workflow could be canceled immediately when the HTTP request completed.
- `go/internal/httpapi/native_supervisor_handlers.go`
  - `handleNativeSupervisorStart` now detaches from the request context before starting supervised processes.
  - This fixes a real stability issue where supervised commands could be tied to the lifetime of the originating HTTP request.

### Added regression tests
- `go/internal/workflow/engine_test.go`
  - verifies dependency-output propagation across workflow steps
  - verifies dependent-step skipping when an upstream step fails
- `go/internal/httpapi/native_endpoints_test.go`
  - verifies native workflow create/list/get/run flows
  - verifies native supervisor create/list/start/status flows
  - verifies native session export endpoint writes exported artifacts and manifest

### Validation performed in the follow-up pass
Commands run:
```bash
cd go && go test ./internal/workflow -run 'TestWorkflow'
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi -run 'TestNative(Workflow|Supervisor|SessionExport)'
cd go && go test ./internal/sessionimport -run 'Test'
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
```

Results:
- all newly added targeted tests passed
- Go sidecar build passed

### Important validation note
A broader run of `go test ./internal/httpapi` initially reported several failures on bridge/fallback routes. Those failures were investigated in the next pass and a meaningful subset was fixed directly.

## Follow-up bridge/fallback repair pass
A subsequent stabilization pass fixed several **truthfulness and compatibility regressions** in extracted Go handlers.

### Additional fixes in this pass
- `go/internal/httpapi/memory_handlers.go`
  - `handleMemorySearch` now behaves as a true bridge-first handler:
    - upstream procedure: `memory.query`
    - local fallback: empty-or-real local SQLite search results with explicit fallback metadata
  - `handleMemoryContexts` now bridges to `memory.listContexts` and falls back to the local contexts registry via `.hypercode/memory/contexts.json`
  - `handleMemorySectionedStatus` now bridges to `memory.getSectionedMemoryStatus` and includes explicit fallback metadata when using local sectioned-memory status
- `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go`
  - `handleMCPStatus` now bridges to `mcp.getStatus` and falls back to local harness summary data with lifecycle mode fields preserved
  - `handleMCPTools` now bridges to `mcp.listTools` and falls back to source-backed local tool inventory
  - `handleMCPSearchTools` now bridges to `mcp.searchTools`, preserves request payload shape (including `profile`), and falls back to local source-backed search results
  - `handleMCPRuntimeServers` now bridges to `mcp.listServers` and falls back to local runtime-server summaries
- `go/internal/httpapi/council_base_handlers.go`
  - `handleCouncilBaseDebate` now accepts both `objective` and `description` style payloads
  - upstream bridge payload now includes `description`, fixing compatibility with the existing test/route contract
  - local fallback still normalizes to a debate objective internally
- `go/internal/memorystore/search.go`
  - missing database files and missing tables now degrade to an empty result set instead of surfacing misleading internal errors for normal fallback flows

### Regression tests validated in this pass
Commands run:
```bash
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi -run 'TestMemorySectionedStatusAndFormatsFallBackLocally|TestMemoryContextsFallsBackToLocalRegistry|TestReadOnlyMemoryRoutesFallBackLocally|TestMCPLifecycleModesFallBackToLocalState|TestCouncilBaseBridgeRoutes|TestMCPBridgeRoutes|TestMCPReadRoutesFallBackToLocalSummary|TestMCPSearchToolsFallsBackToLocalInventory|TestMemoryBridgeRoutes'
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi -run 'Test(Native(Workflow|Supervisor|SessionExport)|MemorySectionedStatusAndFormatsFallBackLocally|MemoryContextsFallsBackToLocalRegistry|ReadOnlyMemoryRoutesFallBackLocally|MCPLifecycleModesFallBackToLocalState|CouncilBaseBridgeRoutes|MCPBridgeRoutes|MCPReadRoutesFallBackToLocalSummary|MCPSearchToolsFallsBackToLocalInventory|MemoryBridgeRoutes)'
cd go && go test ./internal/workflow ./internal/sessionimport
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
```

Results:
- all targeted previously failing `httpapi` tests in scope now pass
- previously added native endpoint tests still pass
- `internal/workflow` and `internal/sessionimport` tests pass
- Go sidecar build passes

### Updated truthfulness assessment
The affected bridge/fallback routes are now more credible because they:
- preserve the existing TypeScript procedure names expected by tests and clients
- return bridge metadata consistently
- degrade to empty local results where appropriate instead of throwing avoidable internal errors

## Follow-up git fallback hardening pass
After the bridge/fallback repair work, the next stabilization pass hardened the native git submodule fallback implementation and extended regression coverage.

### Additional fixes in this pass
- `go/internal/git/submodules.go`
  - replaced brittle ad-hoc submodule status parsing with dedicated helpers:
    - `parseSubmoduleStatusLine(...)`
    - `parseSubmoduleStatusOutput(...)`
  - parsing no longer relies on slicing off the first character of a status line
  - parsed submodule paths are now sorted deterministically
  - update report details are now sorted deterministically for more stable behavior and easier testing
  - `filepathBase(...)` now handles both forward-slash and backslash style paths safely
- `go/internal/git/submodules_test.go`
  - covers status-line parsing for:
    - clean entries
    - missing entries (`-`)
    - modified entries (`+`)
    - conflicted entries (`U`)
    - malformed / blank lines
  - covers deterministic sorted output parsing
  - covers slash and backslash base-name extraction
- `go/internal/httpapi/git_native_test.go`
  - covers `/api/submodules/update-all` native fallback behavior in a real temporary git repo with no submodules
  - verifies fallback metadata and empty-report semantics (`total=0`, `successful=0`, `failed=0`)

### Validation performed in this pass
Commands run:
```bash
cd go && go test ./internal/git ./internal/httpapi -run 'Test(SubmoduleUpdateAllFallsBackToNativeGitReport)'
cd go && go test ./...
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
```

Results:
- targeted git/httpapi fallback test passed
- **entire Go test suite passed**
- Go sidecar build passed

### Major milestone
At this point in the stabilization sequence:
- the repaired `httpapi` bridge/fallback surfaces are green
- the new native workflow/supervisor/export tests are green
- the native git fallback tests are green
- **`cd go && go test ./...` is green**

## Follow-up MCP and provider-routing test coverage pass
With the core Go suite green, the next stabilization pass added regression coverage around MCP inventory/ranking and native provider selection behavior.

### Additional fixes and hardening in this pass
- `go/internal/ai/llm.go`
  - extracted provider selection into a testable helper: `resolveProviderSelection()`
  - `ListConfiguredProviders()` now deduplicates alias-backed providers (notably Google via `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- `go/internal/ai/llm_test.go`
  - verifies provider priority ordering (`anthropic > google > openai > deepseek > openrouter`)
  - verifies Gemini alias resolution via `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  - verifies configured-provider listing is deduplicated
  - explicitly clears ambient workstation provider env vars inside tests to avoid false results from the local machine environment
- `go/internal/mcp/inventory_test.go`
  - verifies JSONC config loading with comment stripping
  - verifies mixed inventory loading from both:
    - config (`mcp.json`/`mcp.jsonc`)
    - SQLite database (`packages/core/metamcp.db`)
  - verifies server/tool normalization and database-source preference when DB-backed tool rows are present
- `go/internal/mcp/ranking_test.go`
  - verifies token normalization/filtering
  - verifies ranking prefers strong name matches over weaker description matches
  - verifies tags/semantic groups contribute to ranking
  - verifies empty-query ranking behaves as a stable default listing
- `go/internal/providers/routing_test.go`
  - verifies catalog entries inherit configured/authenticated status from provider snapshots
  - verifies routing summaries reflect configured providers for coding/planning task preferences

### Validation performed in this pass
Commands run:
```bash
cd go && go test ./internal/mcp ./internal/ai ./internal/providers
cd go && go test ./...
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
```

Results:
- targeted MCP / AI / providers tests passed
- full Go suite remained green
- Go sidecar build passed

### Updated truthfulness assessment
This pass did not introduce large new runtime surfaces; it improved confidence and correctness around existing ones:
- MCP inventory loading behavior is now covered for both config and DB-backed sources
- MCP ranking behavior is now regression-tested
- provider selection order is now testable and less vulnerable to environment-specific ambiguity
- provider alias handling is now more truthful in configured-provider summaries

## Follow-up supervisor and exporter coverage pass
With MCP/provider behavior covered, the next stabilization pass added regression coverage for the Go supervisor and session exporter.

### Additional coverage in this pass
- `go/internal/supervisor/supervisor_test.go`
  - verifies duplicate session creation is rejected
  - verifies a short-lived supervised process reaches `stopped`
  - verifies missing sessions return an error on start
  - verifies a failing process restarts according to `MaxRestarts` and eventually reaches `failed`
  - verifies session metadata is captured correctly at creation time
  - uses short-lived commands only; no long-running process management was introduced
- `go/internal/sessionimport/exporter_test.go`
  - verifies `BuildManifest()` reflects candidate counts and timestamps
  - verifies `ExportSessions()` writes exported session files and `export-manifest.json`
  - verifies exported content matches the source content
  - verifies default export directory behavior when no output path is provided

### Validation performed in this pass
Commands run:
```bash
cd go && go test ./internal/supervisor ./internal/sessionimport
cd go && go test ./...
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
```

Results:
- targeted supervisor/sessionimport tests passed
- full Go suite remained green
- Go sidecar build passed

### Updated truthfulness assessment
The Go sidecar now has meaningful test coverage across more of its critical local-runtime responsibilities:
- HTTP bridge/fallback routes
- workflow execution
- supervisor process lifecycle basics
- session export generation
- MCP inventory/ranking
- provider selection/routing summaries
- native git submodule fallback behavior

## Follow-up council/sync coverage and CLI startup resilience pass
A later stabilization pass addressed two additional areas:
1. regression coverage for the Go council debate engine and BobbyBookmarks sync
2. an operator-facing startup fix for the CLI when port `4000` is already occupied by an existing HyperCode instance

### Additional coverage and fixes in this pass
- `go/internal/orchestration/council.go`
  - introduced a test seam via package-level `autoRoute` indirection so council debate tests can run deterministically without calling live provider APIs
- `go/internal/orchestration/council_test.go`
  - verifies approved debate flow
  - verifies rejected debate flow
  - verifies architect-stage provider errors are propagated clearly
- `go/internal/sync/bobbybookmarks.go`
  - tightened response/body handling inside the pagination loop
  - explicit decode errors are now reported in `SyncReport.Errors`
  - explicit `stmt.Close()` / `tx.Commit()` error handling added for clearer failure reporting
- `go/internal/sync/bobbybookmarks_test.go`
  - verifies paginated BobbyBookmarks payloads are fetched and upserted into SQLite
  - verifies malformed JSON payloads are surfaced as sync-report errors instead of silently proceeding
- `packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts`
  - added `isHypercodeServer(host, port, fetchImpl)` health probing helper
  - `acquireSingleInstanceLock(...)` now distinguishes between:
    - a foreign process occupying the requested port
    - an already-running HyperCode instance occupying that port
  - when the port is occupied by a live HyperCode instance, startup now exits cleanly with a reuse message instead of failing hard
  - introduced `HypercodeAlreadyRunningError` to represent the non-fatal reuse case explicitly
- `packages/cli/src/commands/start.test.ts`
  - verifies occupied-port behavior still errors for non-HyperCode processes
  - verifies occupied-port behavior is treated as an already-running instance when HyperCode health checks succeed
  - verifies `isHypercodeServer(...)` detection against JSON health responses

### User-reported startup issue addressed
Observed from a real operator run:
- `start.bat` completed install/build steps
- the hub failed at the final CLI startup phase with:
  - `Port 4000 is already in use by another process`
- direct probing showed that `127.0.0.1:4000` was accepting TCP connections but returning generic Express-style `404 Cannot GET /...` responses for the initial HyperCode health probes

This revealed **two distinct occupied-port cases**:
1. the port is occupied by an existing HyperCode instance → reuse it cleanly
2. the port is occupied by a different process and the user did not explicitly request that port → automatically fall forward to the next free control-plane port instead of failing hard

The CLI now handles both cases non-destructively.

### Additional startup hardening in the follow-up pass
- `packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts`
  - `acquireSingleInstanceLock(...)` now falls forward to the next available control-plane port **during lock acquisition**, not only later during core bind retry
  - this specifically fixes the case where startup previously failed before the existing runtime fallback logic even had a chance to run
  - startup now emits a clear note when the default port was occupied and a new port is selected
- `packages/cli/src/commands/start.test.ts`
  - added regression coverage verifying that a non-HyperCode process on the default port causes automatic fallback to the next free port when the user did not explicitly request a port

### Validation performed in this pass
Commands run:
```bash
pnpm exec vitest run packages/cli/src/commands/start.test.ts
cd packages/cli && pnpm run type-check
pnpm -C packages/cli build
cd go && go test ./internal/orchestration ./internal/sync
cd go && go test ./...
pnpm run build:workspace
```

Results:
- CLI startup tests passed (`26/26` in `start.test.ts`)
- CLI type-check passed
- CLI package build passed
- council/sync tests passed
- full Go suite remained green
- workspace build remained green

### Updated truthfulness assessment
This pass improved both operator UX and native-sidecar confidence:
- startup is now more truthful when an existing HyperCode instance is already serving the requested port
- startup is also more resilient when the default port is occupied by a different process, because it can now automatically fall forward to the next free port
- council fallback logic is now testable without live model calls
- BobbyBookmarks sync error handling is stricter and now covered by tests

## Follow-up quota-default migration pass (OpenRouter Free)
A later pass responded directly to real operator logs showing two independent problems in the TypeScript runtime:

1. **Node SQLite addon fragility on Windows / Node 24**
   - `better-sqlite3` failed to load
   - this degraded DB-backed startup services such as:
     - HyperIngest / `LinkCrawlerWorker`
     - debate history initialization
     - imported session persistence
     - transcript deduplication
2. **Hosted-provider quota exhaustion**
   - OpenAI returned `429` quota errors
   - Anthropic returned `400` insufficient credit errors
   - startup/import flows were then forced through provider failover behavior

### Design decision from those logs
Quota-sensitive TypeScript services should no longer default to paid OpenAI/Anthropic models when a free OpenRouter path is available.

### Runtime changes made in this pass
- `packages/ai/src/ModelSelector.ts`
  - introduced `DEFAULT_OPENROUTER_FREE_MODEL = 'xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free'`
  - default worker/supervisor selection chains now prefer OpenRouter free before paid cloud providers
  - OpenRouter credential detection added to the legacy selector (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- `packages/ai/src/LLMService.ts`
  - added executable OpenRouter support using the OpenAI-compatible API surface
  - OpenRouter client is now initialized from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  - optional `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER`, and `OPENROUTER_X_TITLE` support included
- `packages/core/src/providers/ProviderRegistry.ts`
  - OpenRouter is now marked executable
  - OpenRouter default model switched from `openrouter/auto` to `xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free`
  - OpenRouter free model added as a first-class executable, zero-cost candidate
  - OpenRouter preferred task coverage added for coding / research / general / worker

### Hardcoded quota-sensitive service defaults switched to OpenRouter free
The following direct service calls were changed from paid defaults to:
- provider: `openrouter`
- model: `xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free`

Changed files:
- `packages/core/src/daemons/hyperingest/LinkCrawlerWorker.ts`
- `packages/core/src/services/SessionImportService.ts`
- `packages/core/src/services/HealerService.ts`
- `packages/core/src/services/DarwinService.ts`
- `packages/core/src/services/SkillAssimilationService.ts`
- `packages/core/src/reactors/MemoryHarvestReactor.ts`
- `packages/core/src/services/PreemptiveToolAdvertiser.ts`
- `packages/core/src/suggestions/SuggestionService.ts`
- `packages/core/src/agents/swarm/SwarmOrchestrator.ts` (default model)

### Council default-path support
Basic OpenRouter support was also extended into the council supervisor path:
- `packages/core/src/orchestrator/council/types.ts`
- `packages/core/src/orchestrator/council/supervisors/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/orchestrator/council/services/config.ts`

This does **not** mean every council policy/template is now fully OpenRouter-optimized, but it does mean the default env-driven council config can now include an OpenRouter free supervisor instead of being locked to paid-provider assumptions.

### Validation performed in this pass
Commands run:
```bash
pnpm -C packages/ai test
pnpm -C packages/core exec vitest run src/providers/CoreModelSelector.test.ts src/routers/council/index.test.ts src/services/HealerService.test.ts src/services/SessionImportService.test.ts
pnpm -C packages/ai build
pnpm -C packages/core build
pnpm -C apps/web build
pnpm run build:workspace
```

Results:
- `packages/ai` tests passed
- targeted `packages/core` tests passed
- `packages/ai` and `packages/core` builds passed
- `apps/web` build passed
- full workspace build passed

### Important validation note
A broad `packages/core` test run still has unrelated noisy/failing areas in other suites, so this migration was validated using the smallest truthful targeted set covering:
- selector behavior
- OpenRouter execution path
- council config compatibility
- direct-service regression guard (`HealerService`)
- session import unchanged behavior under mocked LLM failures

## Follow-up startup resilience fix (SQLite-unavailable session import docs)
A real operator crash later showed one remaining non-truthful startup edge:
- `SessionImportService.scanAndImport()` already degraded gracefully when imported-session SQLite persistence failed
- but the final `writeInstructionDocs()` step still called `ImportedSessionStore.listInstructionMemories()` as if SQLite were always available
- when `better-sqlite3` was missing on Windows / Node 24, startup could still abort from imported-session instruction-doc generation even though the main SQLite error text explicitly claimed the control plane could continue running

### Fix made
- `packages/core/src/services/SessionImportService.ts`
  - `writeInstructionDocs()` now catches SQLite-unavailable failures from `listInstructionMemories()`
  - logs a concise degraded-mode warning via `formatOptionalSqliteFailure(...)`
  - returns `null` for `instructionDocPath` instead of aborting startup/import execution
  - auto-import startup iterations now run through a guarded helper so failed background scans are logged instead of surfacing as unhandled async failures
  - Prism DB discovery and `llm` CLI `logs.db` discovery now also emit concise degraded-mode SQLite warnings instead of dumping full native-binding probe noise
- `packages/core/src/daemons/hyperingest/LinkCrawlerWorker.ts`
  - SQLite-unavailable backlog access now logs once concisely instead of repeatedly printing noisy stack traces
- `packages/core/src/daemons/hyperingest/BobbyBookmarksSyncWorker.ts`
  - SQLite-unavailable sync failures now log once concisely and stop the current sync pass instead of failing row-by-row opaquely

### Regression coverage added
- `packages/core/src/services/SessionImportService.test.ts`
  - added coverage for the exact failure mode where `listInstructionMemories()` throws a `better-sqlite3`-missing / SQLite-unavailable error
  - added coverage for the guarded auto-import iteration path
  - verifies:
    - import scan still succeeds
    - `instructionDocPath` is `null`
    - failed auto-import iterations are swallowed/logged instead of escaping
    - warnings remain concise and do not dump the full native-binding probe spam

### Validation performed for this fix
```bash
pnpm -C packages/core exec vitest run src/services/SessionImportService.test.ts
pnpm -C packages/core build
```

Results:
- targeted `SessionImportService` regression suite passed
- `packages/core` build passed

## Go-primary architecture mandate (new explicit direction)
The migration target is now explicit and should govern future work:
- Go should become the **primary runtime/control plane**
- every meaningful backend feature/function should be ported, translated, or forked into Go
- TypeScript should be reduced over time to only the most crucial UI/client/compatibility roles until those can also be retired where practical

To make that direction concrete instead of aspirational, two planning docs were added:
- `docs/ai/planning/GO_PRIMARY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/ai/planning/GO_PARITY_MATRIX.md`

These documents define:
- the authoritative target state
- parity status buckets (`Native Go`, `Bridge-first`, `Bridge-only`, `Missing`, `TS-only critical`)
- the highest-priority blockers to a truthful Go-primary claim
- the recommended migration order:
  1. Go-primary launcher/control-plane ownership
  2. remaining TS SQLite-backed startup-service migration
  3. MCP backend write/config parity
  4. orchestration/session/council parity
  5. dashboard/backend contract migration away from TS ownership

## Follow-up launcher step (Go-primary runtime selection)
The next concrete implementation step after defining the migration plan was to make launcher/runtime selection reflect that goal.

### What changed
- `packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts`
  - added `--runtime <auto|go|node>`
  - default runtime selection is now `auto`, which **prefers Go first**
  - added explicit Go config-dir derivation for the Go control plane (`.hypercode-go` sibling by default)
  - added Go health/readiness polling using the Go `/health` / `/api/health/server` surfaces
  - added Go child-process startup via `go run ./cmd/hypercode serve ...`
  - if `--runtime auto` is used and Go startup fails, launcher now falls back truthfully to the Node compatibility runtime
  - if `--runtime go` is used, startup fails explicitly instead of silently downgrading
  - integrated dashboard startup is now **intentionally skipped in Go runtime mode** with an explicit warning, because the current web UI still depends heavily on TS/tRPC compatibility contracts
  - added truthful warnings that `--no-mcp`, `--supervisor`, and `--auto-drive` currently map to Node-startup behavior more than Go-startup behavior

### Important truthfulness note
This is a **Go-primary launcher preference**, not full Go-primary product parity.

What is true now:
- the operator can explicitly select `go`, `node`, or `auto`
- `auto` prefers the Go control plane first
- Node remains the compatibility fallback when Go startup fails
- dashboard startup is treated honestly instead of pretending the web app is already fully Go-native

What is **not** true yet:
- the web dashboard is not fully Go-backed
- all Node startup flags do not yet map 1:1 to Go startup semantics
- the overall repo should still be described as **in migration toward Go-primary**, not fully there

### Validation performed for this launcher step
```bash
pnpm -C packages/cli exec vitest run src/commands/start.test.ts
pnpm -C packages/cli run type-check
pnpm -C packages/cli build
```

Results:
- CLI start tests passed (`33/33`)
- CLI type-check passed
- CLI build passed

## Follow-up Go ingestion step (native links backlog crawler)
The next stateful migration slice targeted one of the remaining TS-only startup-critical services:
- `packages/core/src/daemons/hyperingest/LinkCrawlerWorker.ts`

### Goal
Create a native Go execution path for backlog crawling/enrichment so this surface is no longer exclusively dependent on the TypeScript runtime.

### What changed
- added `go/internal/sync/linkcrawler.go`
  - native pending-link selection from `links_backlog`
  - HTTP fetch with timeout and browser-like headers
  - lightweight HTML metadata extraction for:
    - page title
    - description
    - favicon URL
    - visible text body
  - backlog row status transitions:
    - `pending` → `running` → `done` / `failed`
  - HTTP status persistence for crawl failures
  - optional tag classification hook
  - default AI-backed tag classifier wired through Go `ai.AutoRouteWithModel(...)` using `xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free`
- added `go/internal/sync/linkcrawler_manager.go`
  - Go-owned background worker lifecycle for backlog crawling
  - periodic loop execution
  - run counters / last report / last error / timestamps
  - clean start/stop behavior
- added `go/internal/httpapi/server.go` routes:
  - `POST /api/links-backlog/crawl-native`
  - `GET /api/links-backlog/crawler-native/status`
  - `POST /api/links-backlog/crawler-native/start`
  - `POST /api/links-backlog/crawler-native/stop`
- Go server now auto-starts the native link crawler by default during `ListenAndServe(...)`
  - can be controlled with env:
    - `HYPERCODE_NATIVE_LINK_CRAWLER_AUTOSTART`
    - `HYPERCODE_NATIVE_LINK_CRAWLER_INTERVAL_MS`
    - `HYPERCODE_NATIVE_LINK_CRAWLER_CLASSIFY_TAGS`
- updated Go API index metadata so the new routes are discoverable
- added regression coverage:
  - `go/internal/sync/linkcrawler_test.go`
  - `go/internal/sync/linkcrawler_manager_test.go`
  - `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`

### Important truthfulness note
This is **not yet** full cross-runtime ownership parity with the TS background worker.

What is true now:
- Go can natively crawl and enrich pending backlog links
- Go exposes that capability via real HTTP endpoints
- the Go server now owns a native crawler background loop when the Go control plane is the active runtime
- the native path is tested

What is not true yet:
- the TS `LinkCrawlerWorker` still exists in the mixed-runtime world
- overall repo behavior is still transitional because not every operator path is Go-only yet

So this surface should still be described as **Partial Native Go**, but it is materially closer to Go ownership than before.

### Validation performed for this crawler step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/sync/linkcrawler.go go/internal/sync/linkcrawler_test.go go/internal/sync/linkcrawler_manager.go go/internal/sync/linkcrawler_manager_test.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/sync ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted sync/httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go persistence step (native imported-session store)
The next migration slice targeted another TS-owned startup-critical persistence area:
- imported-session storage
- transcript-hash dedup
- imported-session memory rows
- instruction-doc generation
- maintenance stats

### What changed
- added `go/internal/sessionimport/store.go`
  - native imported-session store over `metamcp.db`
  - ensures imported-session tables/indexes exist when accessed from Go
  - transcript-hash dedup
  - archived transcript + sidecar metadata gzip persistence
  - imported-session memory row persistence
  - native list/get/instruction-memory/maintenance APIs at the package layer
  - native instruction-doc generation/listing
- added `go/internal/httpapi/server.go` route:
  - `POST /api/sessions/imported/persist-native`
- updated existing imported-session fallback handlers to prefer the native Go store before archive-only or scan-only fallbacks:
  - `/api/sessions/imported/list`
  - `/api/sessions/imported/get`
  - `/api/sessions/imported/instruction-docs`
  - `/api/sessions/imported/maintenance-stats`
  - `/api/sessions/imported/scan` summary fallback paths now merge/prefer locally persisted imported-session records when present
- added regression coverage:
  - `go/internal/sessionimport/store_test.go`
  - expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`

### Important truthfulness note
This is a major step toward Go ownership, but it is **not yet** full native imported-session parity.

What is true now:
- Go has a real imported-session persistence layer
- Go owns transcript-hash dedup for this native lane
- Go can persist imported-session memory rows and regenerate imported instruction docs
- Go imported-session read fallbacks now prefer persistent local state instead of dropping immediately to archive-only/scan-only summaries
- Go exposes a native write surface (`persist-native`) for imported sessions

What is not true yet:
- full native scan/import parsing with the same richness as the TS `SessionImportService` is not complete
- broader retention-summary backfill/migration ownership is still partial
- the repo still contains the TS imported-session pipeline in the mixed-runtime world

### Validation performed for this imported-session step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/sessionimport/store.go go/internal/sessionimport/store_test.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/sessionimport ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted sessionimport/httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go persistence step (native debate history store)
The next stateful migration slice targeted another TS-only critical persistence lane:
- council debate history storage
- council history read/query/delete flows
- native fallback debate persistence when Go council execution is used

### What changed
- added `go/internal/orchestration/history.go`
  - native debate-history store over `metamcp.db`
  - native `council_debates` schema ensure/create path
  - record count, status, storage size
  - config/toggle state in the Go runtime
  - stats aggregation
  - list/get/delete/clear/supervisor-history operations
  - save path for native Go debate fallback results
- wired the Go server to own a native debate-history store
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/council_history_handlers.go`
  - native fallbacks for:
    - `status`
    - `getConfig`
    - `updateConfig`
    - `toggle`
    - `stats`
    - `list`
    - `get`
    - `delete`
    - `supervisorHistory`
    - `clear`
    - `initialize`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/council_base_handlers.go`
  - native Go `council.debate` fallback now persists the resulting debate into the native Go debate-history store
- added/expanded regression coverage in `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - council-history routes now verify native local-store fallback behavior
- full Go suite remained green after the change

### Important truthfulness note
This is a real native persistence upgrade, but not total parity yet.

What is true now:
- Go no longer needs the TS council history router for basic persisted council history reads/writes when upstream is unavailable
- native fallback debates are now saved into persistent history instead of disappearing after the response
- council history status/stats/list/get/delete/clear/supervisor-history all have a native Go fallback path

What is not true yet:
- TS and Go config semantics are not fully harmonized
- broader council orchestration/policy/config parity is still mixed
- the overall repo still has a mixed-runtime council world rather than total Go ownership

### Validation performed for this debate-history step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/orchestration/history.go go/internal/httpapi/council_history_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/council_base_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/orchestration ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted orchestration/httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go ingestion step (native imported-session ingest)
The next migration slice moved imported-session handling beyond scan/export + persistence plumbing into a real native ingest path.

### What changed
- added `go/internal/sessionimport/ingest.go`
  - native scan-to-store ingest for supported **file-based** imported-session artifacts
  - JSON / JSONL transcript normalization
  - transcript-hash generation
  - heuristic memory extraction
  - retention-summary generation
  - persistence into the native Go imported-session store
  - instruction-doc regeneration after ingest
  - explicit skip reporting for currently unsupported DB-backed import artifacts
- added `go/internal/httpapi/server.go` route:
  - `POST /api/sessions/imported/ingest-native`
- added/updated regression coverage:
  - `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - ingest route now verifies successful native file-based import plus truthful skipping of DB-backed candidates that are not yet implemented natively

### Important truthfulness note
This is a meaningful ownership upgrade, but not complete imported-session parity yet.

What is true now:
- Go can scan discovered imported-session artifacts
- Go can ingest supported file-based artifacts natively
- Go can derive basic heuristic memories and regenerate imported instruction docs from that native ingest path
- Go can persist those records into the native imported-session store
- unsupported DB-backed artifacts are skipped explicitly instead of being faked as ingested

What is not true yet:
- native DB-backed import parsing for `llm-cli` / Prism-style sources is not yet implemented
- full parity with the richer TS `SessionImportService` parsing/analysis path is still incomplete

### Validation performed for this native ingest step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/sessionimport/ingest.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/sessionimport ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted sessionimport/httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go parser step (DB-backed imported-session parity)
The next imported-session gap was the DB-backed artifact lane:
- `llm-cli` `logs.db`
- Prism `data.db`

### What changed
- added `go/internal/sessionimport/db_ingest.go`
  - native Prism DB parsing for:
    - `session_ledger`
    - `session_handoffs`
  - native `llm-cli` DB parsing for:
    - `conversations`
    - orphan `responses`
    - `tool_calls`
    - `tool_results`
  - transcript stitching for tool call/result context
  - metadata extraction for model ids, token counts, Prism fields, and working-directory hints
- updated `go/internal/sessionimport/ingest.go`
  - DB-backed candidates are no longer blanket-skipped
  - native ingest now expands DB artifacts into one-or-more imported-session records and persists them through the Go store
- added regression coverage:
  - `go/internal/sessionimport/db_ingest_test.go`
  - expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go` to exercise `ingest-native` against a real `llm-cli` SQLite DB

### Important truthfulness note
This meaningfully improves parity, but should still be described as **partial**, not complete.

What is true now:
- Go-native imported-session ingest now supports both file-based artifacts and key DB-backed artifacts
- Go no longer has to skip `llm-cli` / Prism DB artifacts in the native ingest lane
- Go can persist those imported sessions into the native store with heuristic memories and regenerated instruction docs

What is not true yet:
- the TS parser still contains broader ecosystem-specific richness and edge-case handling
- additional niche formats and special-case extraction paths may still lag behind TS

### Validation performed for this DB-backed parser step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/sessionimport/db_ingest.go go/internal/sessionimport/db_ingest_test.go go/internal/sessionimport/ingest.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go
cd go && go test ./internal/sessionimport ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted sessionimport/httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP authority fix (configured-server JSONC-first reads)
The next migration slice returned to MCP backend authority and fixed an important internal inconsistency in the Go fallback path.

### Problem
Go already had native configured-server **mutation** fallbacks backed by local `mcp.jsonc`, but configured-server **read** fallbacks still preferred `metamcp.db` rows plus JSONC metadata overlay.

That meant the local source of truth for configured-server reads and writes did not match, which is the wrong shape for a Go-primary MCP config lane.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - `/api/mcp/servers/configured` now prefers native JSONC-backed configured-server reads first
  - `/api/mcp/servers/get` now prefers native JSONC-backed configured-server reads first
  - local DB fallback remains available as a legacy secondary fallback when JSONC does not provide the configured server
- added `localConfiguredMCPServerByUUID(...)`
- updated MCP configured-server tests so they verify:
  - local JSONC is authoritative when present
  - DB remains secondary fallback behavior

### Important truthfulness note
This does **not** mean full MCP parity is complete.

What is true now:
- native configured-server create/update/delete already existed
- native configured-server read fallback now uses the same local source of truth (JSONC) as those writes
- Go MCP configured-server CRUD is materially more coherent than before

What is not true yet:
- full runtime mutation, telemetry, and metadata refresh parity is still incomplete
- some MCP admin/config surfaces remain bridge-heavy or placeholder-like

### Validation performed for this MCP authority step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP metadata step (truthful JSONC metadata inspection)
After aligning configured-server read/write authority around JSONC, the next improvement targeted the stale placeholder behavior in native metadata refresh/cache endpoints.

### What changed
- `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - native configured-server metadata reload now performs a truthful local JSONC inspection/cache normalization pass instead of only stamping a generic placeholder state
  - cached tool metadata is preserved and normalized when present
  - transport/type hints are derived from the configured server entry
  - metadata source now differentiates between:
    - `jsonc-cache`
    - `jsonc-derived`
    - `cleared`
  - `reloadDecision` now distinguishes cache-backed inspection from cleared-cache state instead of always returning `go-local-placeholder`
- `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - updated metadata refresh/cache tests to verify the new truthful semantics

### Important truthfulness note
This is better than the previous placeholder path, but it is still **not** a full binary/tool discovery refresh parity implementation.

What is true now:
- native metadata reload no longer pretends the same thing happened in every case
- if cached tools exist in JSONC metadata, Go reports that honestly
- if no cache exists, Go now says it only inspected local JSONC/config state and did not perform full binary probing
- clear-cache behavior is explicitly represented as a cleared local metadata state

What is not true yet:
- native Go metadata refresh still does not perform full downstream binary execution + tool discovery parity
- real tool schema/tool-count refresh from live server process probing remains incomplete in Go

### Validation performed for this metadata step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP live probe step (native stdio tools/list refresh)
The next MCP slice moved metadata refresh beyond JSONC/cache inspection into a real live probe path where practical.

### What changed
- `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - native metadata reload now attempts a live stdio MCP `tools/list` probe when the configured server is:
    - local / command-backed
    - `STDIO`
    - not explicitly cache-only mode
  - successful live probe now produces metadata like:
    - `metadataSource: live-probe`
    - real `toolCount`
    - real `tools` payload
    - `lastSuccessfulBinaryLoadAt`
    - `reloadDecision: go-local-live-stdio`
  - probe failures now degrade truthfully back to JSONC/cache inspection semantics with explicit error state instead of pretending success
- `go/internal/mcp/client.go`
  - fixed child process env handling so stdio MCP child processes inherit the current environment and remain viable on Windows
  - switched outbound JSON-RPC request ids to strings so response correlation is robust instead of depending on mixed int/float interface behavior
- `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added a live stdio probe regression test using a local shell/powershell helper process that responds to `tools/list`

### Important truthfulness note
This is a real step forward, but still not universal MCP live discovery parity.

What is true now:
- Go can perform live stdio `tools/list` refresh for probeable configured servers
- successful probe results are persisted back into JSONC metadata
- Go no longer relies only on cached/derived metadata for every refresh attempt

What is not true yet:
- live discovery parity across non-stdio transports is still incomplete
- richer multi-step MCP initialization/probing semantics are still partial
- some MCP admin/operator surfaces remain mixed or bridge-heavy

### Validation performed for this live probe step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/mcp/client.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi/mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP runtime mutation step (native runtime registry)
The next MCP slice targeted the gap between config mutation and runtime mutation.

### Problem
Go already had local configured-server config mutation fallbacks, but runtime add/remove/list fallback behavior was still shallow:
- runtime add/remove mostly looked like config-adjacent wrappers
- runtime list fallback did not reflect a native Go-owned registry of added runtime servers

### What changed
- added `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_runtime_registry.go`
  - native in-memory runtime server registry
  - best-effort runtime probe state for added stdio servers
  - stored fields include runtime connectivity, tool count, tool inventory status, last check time, and last error
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - server now owns a `runtimeServers` registry
  - `/api/mcp/runtime-servers/add` now:
    - persists configured server fallback state
    - best-effort probes the added runtime server
    - records native runtime server state in the Go registry
  - `/api/mcp/runtime-servers/remove` now:
    - removes both configured-server fallback state and native runtime registry state
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go`
  - `/api/mcp/servers/runtime` fallback now includes the native Go runtime registry snapshot alongside the existing local runtime summary

### Important truthfulness note
This is a meaningful runtime mutation upgrade, but still not complete runtime lifecycle parity.

What is true now:
- Go fallback mode has a real runtime server registry for add/remove/list
- runtime mutation is no longer only config-shaped
- added runtime servers can carry native best-effort probe results in the Go lane

What is not true yet:
- runtime servers are not managed with full persistent lifecycle parity across all transports
- there is still no full native equivalent of every TS runtime orchestration behavior

### Validation performed for this runtime mutation step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_runtime_registry.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP state step (native working-set / telemetry fallback state)
The next MCP slice targeted a cluster of operator-facing fallback gaps that were still effectively empty/no-op in Go mode:
- working-set snapshot
- tool load/unload fallback behavior
- hydrated schema tracking
- eviction history
- tool-selection telemetry

### What changed
- added `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_local_state.go`
  - Go-owned in-memory MCP state manager
  - tracks loaded tools
  - tracks hydrated schemas
  - tracks eviction history
  - tracks tool-selection telemetry
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - local available-tool resolution now combines:
    - configured-server JSONC `_meta.tools`
    - runtime registry live-probe tools
  - `/api/mcp/working-set` now returns a real local snapshot instead of a hardcoded empty state
  - `/api/mcp/working-set/evictions` now returns real local eviction history
  - `/api/mcp/working-set/evictions/clear` now clears real local eviction history
  - `/api/mcp/tool-selection-telemetry` now returns local telemetry events
  - `/api/mcp/tool-selection-telemetry/clear` now clears local telemetry events
  - `/api/mcp/working-set/load` and `/api/mcp/working-set/unload` now use the local MCP state manager when upstream is unavailable and the requested tool exists in local inventory
  - `/api/mcp/tools/schema` now uses the local state manager to track hydrated schemas and eviction effects when serving local fallback schema payloads
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - local MCP empty-state routes now verify real local fallback state instead of service-unavailable placeholders for every path
  - added a focused working-set/telemetry/eviction fallback test that exercises local load + hydrate + eviction behavior through the real HTTP routes

### Important truthfulness note
This was the first real local operator-state improvement, but at that point it was still **session-local/in-memory parity**, not full durable parity.

What became true in that step:
- Go no longer returned only empty/no-op fallback behavior for key MCP operator state surfaces
- local working-set state, eviction history, and tool-selection telemetry existed in Go fallback mode
- tool load/unload/schema fallback behavior became materially more realistic when local MCP inventory is known

What was still not true after that step:
- the local MCP state was still in-memory only
- it was not yet a full durable replacement for every TS runtime/session working-set behavior
- richer multi-session persistence and long-horizon telemetry parity were still incomplete

### Validation performed for this MCP state step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_local_state.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP durability step (persisted local working-set / telemetry state)
The natural next parity move was to make the new Go-owned MCP local state survive process restarts instead of disappearing with the process.

### What changed
- extended `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_local_state.go`
  - added persisted state snapshot format covering:
    - loaded-tool state
    - telemetry events
    - eviction history
  - added file-backed load-on-start behavior
  - added save-on-mutation behavior
  - persistence target is now `mcp_state.json` under the Go config directory (`cfg.ConfigDir`)
  - persistence snapshots are now cloned under lock before JSON marshalling so file writes do not marshal live mutable maps/slices after unlock
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - `newLocalMCPStateManager(...)` now receives `filepath.Join(cfg.ConfigDir, "mcp_state.json")`
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added persistence coverage proving reload behavior for:
    - loaded working-set state
    - hydrated-schema state
    - eviction history
    - telemetry history
    - clear/unload persistence semantics

### Real bug found and fixed during this step
While adding save-on-mutation behavior I initially introduced an RWMutex misuse by combining `defer m.mu.Unlock()` with explicit pre-save unlocks in mutation methods.

That caused:
- `fatal error: sync: Unlock of unlocked RWMutex`

Root cause:
- mutation functions were explicitly unlocking before `save()` so file I/O would not happen while holding the write lock
- but some functions still retained `defer m.mu.Unlock()`, producing a double-unlock on the successful path

Fix:
- removed deferred unlocks from the affected mutation methods
- switched those methods to explicit unlock paths for both success and early-return branches
- re-ran the full Go suite after the fix

### Important truthfulness note
This is now a materially stronger parity position than the previous in-memory-only step.

What is true now:
- Go fallback mode has persisted local MCP working-set state
- Go fallback mode has persisted local MCP eviction history
- Go fallback mode has persisted local MCP tool-selection telemetry
- this state survives Go process restart/reconstruction so long as the same Go config directory is used
- the persisted state is local-Go-owned rather than bridge-only

What is still not true yet:
- this is still local file-backed parity, not full TS-equivalent durable distributed/session orchestration parity
- there is still no richer long-horizon analytics pipeline or broader TS-equivalent MCP runtime history model in Go
- MCP config import/export/client-sync authority remains unfinished
- runtime-server lifecycle/transport parity is still only partial

### Validation performed for this MCP durability step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_local_state.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP inventory durability step (persisted Go-owned tool inventory cache)
The next recommended parity move was to give the native Go MCP inventory layer its own persisted cache so operator-facing tool list/search surfaces would not depend only on a live bridge, a live DB shape, or a currently hydrated JSONC metadata set.

### What changed
- rewrote `go/internal/mcp/inventory.go`
  - added `LoadInventoryWithCache(workspaceRoot, mainConfigDir, cachePath)`
  - retained existing `LoadInventory(...)` as a compatibility wrapper
  - native inventory can now read from:
    - local `mcp.jsonc` / `mcp.json`
    - local `packages/core/metamcp.db`
    - persisted Go-owned cache file
  - live inventory loads now persist to `mcp_inventory_cache.json`
  - cached inventory reloads now surface as `Source: "cache"`
  - added deterministic sorting plus cloned cache persistence structures for safer/stabler snapshots
- added `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - central Go helpers for:
    - cache path resolution
    - cache-backed inventory loading
    - normalizing cached inventory tool names back to operator-facing tool names
    - formatting MCP fallback tool list/search payloads
    - formatting `/api/tools*` fallback payloads from cached inventory
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go`
  - `/api/mcp/tools` now prefers Go-owned persisted inventory cache fallback when available
  - `/api/mcp/tools/search` now prefers Go-owned persisted inventory cache fallback when available
  - both still retain truthful lower-fidelity summary fallback behavior when cache-backed inventory is unavailable
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - `/api/tools`
  - `/api/tools/by-server`
  - `/api/tools/search`
  - `/api/tools/get`
  now use the Go-owned inventory cache as a secondary fallback when local DB rows are unavailable or empty
- expanded `go/internal/mcp/inventory_test.go`
  - proves cache write-through from live config
  - proves cache-only reload after live sources disappear
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - proves `/api/mcp/tools` and `/api/mcp/tools/search` can serve from persisted inventory cache
  - proves `/api/tools`, `/api/tools/search`, and `/api/tools/get` can recover from persisted inventory cache without local DB rows

### Real bugs / correctness issues found and fixed during this step
#### 1. Source-label bug in inventory loading
Initial cache implementation incorrectly labeled some config-only inventory loads as `database`.

Root cause:
- after the DB open path ran, the code checked whether `inventory.Tools` was non-empty
- but that included tools already loaded from config, so the source label could become misleading even when the DB contributed nothing

Fix:
- track the tool count before DB ingestion
- only switch `inventory.Source` to `database` if the DB path actually added tools beyond the pre-DB count

#### 2. Empty-success masking bug in `/api/tools*` fallback behavior
The local DB helper can truthfully return an empty result rather than an error when the DB file exists but the schema/tables are absent.

Why that mattered:
- the first version of the cache-backed `/api/tools*` recovery only activated on hard DB errors
- that meant a perfectly good persisted inventory cache could remain unused while operators still saw empty lists

Fix:
- `/api/tools*` cache recovery now activates both when the local DB path errors **and** when it returns empty/no-match results

### Important truthfulness note
This materially improves Go-owned MCP inventory authority, but it is still not full end-state parity.

What is true now:
- Go has a persisted local MCP inventory cache file: `mcp_inventory_cache.json`
- Go MCP list/search fallback can now prefer cache-backed inventory data instead of relying only on harness summary fallback
- `/api/tools*` has a stronger secondary fallback path when local DB rows are missing or stale
- cached inventory survives restart and can recover operator-facing tool discovery when live local sources are temporarily absent

What is still not true yet:
- this cache is still a local file-backed cache, not the final authoritative multi-runtime registry model
- cache invalidation/freshness policy is still simple and opportunistic rather than fully lifecycle-managed
- Go still does not own full MCP client sync/import/export parity
- runtime lifecycle and transport parity remain only partial

### Validation performed for this MCP inventory cache step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/mcp/inventory.go go/internal/mcp/inventory_test.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/mcp ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted mcp tests passed
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP cache-authority refinement step (runtime overlay + cache freshness metadata)
The next refinement was to reduce the remaining “split-brain” feeling between:
- persisted MCP inventory cache data
- runtime-registry live-probed tool data
- operator-facing fallback responses

### What changed
- rewrote `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - introduced a `localMCPInventoryView` abstraction that:
    - loads Go-owned persisted inventory/cache state
    - records cache presence and cache path
    - records inventory source and cached timestamp
    - overlays runtime-registry live-probed tools/servers onto the fallback inventory view
    - tracks runtime overlay counts
  - fallback inventory formatting helpers now emit richer tool records including:
    - per-tool source
    - `inventoryCachedAt`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go`
  - cache-backed `/api/mcp/tools`
  - cache-backed `/api/mcp/tools/search`
  now include truthful bridge metadata such as:
    - `inventorySource`
    - `cachedAt`
    - `cachePath`
    - `cachePresent`
    - `runtimeOverlayServerCount`
    - `runtimeOverlayToolCount`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - cache-backed `/api/tools`
  - cache-backed `/api/tools/by-server`
  - cache-backed `/api/tools/search`
  - cache-backed `/api/tools/get`
  now include the same cache/source/freshness metadata on fallback responses
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - persisted inventory cache fallback tests now also prove:
    - runtime overlay tools appear in cache-backed fallback results
    - cache freshness metadata is exposed in fallback responses
    - runtime overlay counts are exposed in bridge metadata

### Why this matters
Before this step, runtime-registry live-probed tools and the persisted inventory cache could both exist, but operators had no clear signal about:
- whether cache-backed results were fresh or stale
- whether runtime-added/probed tools had been incorporated into the fallback view
- whether a response was pure cache, live local inventory, or a blended cache+runtime overlay

This step does not fully solve all cache-authority questions, but it materially improves inspectability and reduces divergence in the most operator-visible fallback routes.

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- cache-backed fallback responses surface cache freshness/source metadata
- runtime live-probed tools can be blended into cache-backed fallback inventory views
- cache-backed MCP/control tool responses are more inspectable and less ambiguous than before

What is still not true yet:
- this is still a response-layer unification step, not a complete single-authority lifecycle manager for all MCP cache state
- persisted inventory cache and JSONC metadata cache are still related but not fully unified under one durable registry model
- runtime overlay data is still opportunistic and memory-scoped unless separately persisted through other flows

### Validation performed for this MCP cache-authority refinement step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP cache-write unification step (JSONC save path now resyncs inventory cache)
The next issue to remove was a real divergence hazard between:
- JSONC-configured server metadata writes
- persisted inventory cache state

### The drift problem
Before this step:
- local configured-server metadata refresh/clear/import flows updated `mcp.jsonc`
- persisted inventory cache state in `mcp_inventory_cache.json` was updated later and opportunistically through inventory loading

That meant a subtle but serious stale-cache risk:
- metadata clear could remove `_meta.tools` from the JSONC truth source
- but an older persisted inventory cache could still carry those tools
- a later cache-backed fallback could then re-surface stale tool inventory that had already been cleared from the authoritative local JSONC state

### What changed
- rewrote `go/internal/mcp/inventory.go`
  - extracted a live-source inventory path (`loadLiveInventory(...)`) that reads only:
    - live `mcp.jsonc` / `mcp.json`
    - live local `metamcp.db`
  - added exported `SyncInventoryCacheFromLiveSources(workspaceRoot, mainConfigDir, cachePath)`
    - rebuilds the inventory cache from live sources only
    - overwrites the cache when live sources exist
    - removes stale cache file state when live sources are empty
  - `LoadInventoryWithCache(...)` still supports cache fallback for read-time recovery, but write-time sync is now explicitly separated from read-time cache fallback
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - `saveLocalMCPJsonc(...)` now calls `mcp.SyncInventoryCacheFromLiveSources(...)` after writing:
    - `mcp.jsonc`
    - compatibility `mcp.json`
  - this means JSONC write/mutation flows now actively keep `mcp_inventory_cache.json` aligned
- expanded `go/internal/mcp/inventory_test.go`
  - added regression coverage proving stale inventory cache files are removed when live sources are empty
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - metadata reload test now verifies the inventory cache is refreshed from JSONC metadata
  - metadata clear test now verifies stale tool entries are removed from the persisted inventory cache

### Real correctness issue found and fixed
The important correctness point here is not a crash bug; it is a **truthfulness bug**.

Without this separation between read-time cache fallback and write-time live-source synchronization, it would be possible for a write path to preserve stale cache truth by accidentally reloading from the old cache while attempting to refresh it.

Fix:
- read-time cache fallback remains in `LoadInventoryWithCache(...)`
- write-time cache synchronization now uses `SyncInventoryCacheFromLiveSources(...)` so it never repopulates the cache from stale cached state during authoritative JSONC writes

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- JSONC save/mutation flows now actively synchronize the Go inventory cache
- metadata clear actions no longer leave stale inventory cache tool rows behind
- metadata refresh actions now update both local JSONC metadata and the persisted inventory cache layer
- cache-backed fallback behavior is better aligned with the actual current local MCP configuration state

What is still not true yet:
- JSONC metadata cache and persisted inventory cache are still two related representations rather than one single stored object model
- runtime overlay data is still not durably folded back into the persisted inventory cache automatically
- broader MCP sync/import/export parity is still unfinished

### Validation performed for this MCP cache-write unification step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/mcp/inventory.go go/internal/mcp/inventory_test.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/mcp ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted mcp tests passed
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP model-unification step (shared canonical metadata-tool mapping)
The next cleanup target was one of the remaining shape-divergence seams: the same conceptual MCP tool metadata was still being translated separately in multiple places.

### The duplication problem
Before this step:
- JSONC `_meta.tools` handling had its own ad hoc normalization path
- live-probe metadata refresh built tool objects manually
- config-driven inventory generation built `ToolEntry` records manually
- runtime overlay inventory generation built `ToolEntry` records manually
- local available-tool resolution parsed raw JSONC tool maps manually

Even when behavior looked correct, this kind of duplication creates subtle drift risk around fields like:
- `alwaysOn`
- `OriginalName`
- `AdvertisedName`
- `InputSchema`
- name normalization / empty-name filtering

### What changed
- added `go/internal/mcp/metadata_tools.go`
  - introduced shared canonical MCP metadata helpers:
    - `MetadataTool`
    - `MetadataToolsFromAny(...)`
    - `MetadataToolsToAny(...)`
    - `ToolEntryFromMetadata(...)`
- updated `go/internal/mcp/inventory.go`
  - config-backed inventory generation now uses the shared canonical metadata-tool helpers instead of bespoke `ToolEntry` assembly
  - config-side `_meta.tools` parsing now also carries `alwaysOn`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - live stdio metadata refresh now serializes tool metadata through the shared canonical helper path
  - JSONC metadata inspection now normalizes `_meta.tools` through the same canonical helper path before recomputing `toolCount` / cache semantics
  - local available-tool resolution now parses `_meta.tools` through the same canonical metadata helper path
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - runtime overlay inventory generation now builds fallback `ToolEntry` records through the shared canonical metadata helper path
  - cache bridge metadata now also exposes explicit authority labels:
    - `cacheAuthority: "go-local-live-sync"`
    - `metadataAuthority: "mcp.jsonc"`
- added `go/internal/mcp/metadata_tools_test.go`
  - direct regression coverage for canonical metadata-tool normalization, encoding, and `ToolEntry` generation
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - cache-backed fallback tests now assert the explicit cache/metadata authority labels

### Real issue found and fixed during this step
This step uncovered a **test fragility** rather than a production logic bug.

Issue:
- `TestMCPLocalStatePersistence` relied on millisecond timestamp ordering between rapid tool-load operations
- under faster execution, multiple operations could land in the same millisecond and make eviction ordering nondeterministic

Fix:
- made the test deterministic by spacing load/hydrate operations slightly instead of assuming unique millisecond timestamps

### Why this matters
This is a structural cleanup step that improves long-term cache correctness.

What is true now:
- JSONC metadata handling and inventory/cache generation now share a canonical metadata-tool mapping path
- `alwaysOn` handling is more consistent across JSONC metadata, inventory cache generation, and fallback inventory views
- fallback responses now state not only freshness but also cache/metadata authority labels
- future MCP cache evolution has fewer parallel conversion paths to keep in sync

What is still not true yet:
- there is still not one single persisted MCP object model for every cache/metadata/runtime layer
- runtime overlay persistence is still separate from canonical cache persistence
- broader MCP runtime/session lifecycle parity is still incomplete

### Validation performed for this MCP model-unification step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/mcp/metadata_tools.go go/internal/mcp/metadata_tools_test.go go/internal/mcp/inventory.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/mcp ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted mcp tests passed
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP runtime-overlay durability step (persist durable runtime overlay in canonical cache)
The next recommended step was to stop treating runtime-probed tool inventory as purely in-memory when it had already been successfully discovered and normalized.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- runtime-registry live-probed tools could appear in fallback responses during the current process lifetime
- but that runtime overlay disappeared with the process
- the canonical inventory cache file did not retain any durable subset of successful runtime-probe results

That meant a cold restart could lose operator-visible runtime-discovered tools even if they had already been successfully probed and normalized earlier.

### What changed
- rewrote `go/internal/mcp/inventory.go`
  - added `RuntimeOverlayServer`
  - added `InventoryCacheSnapshot`
  - the canonical cache file now stores:
    - base inventory snapshot
    - persisted runtime overlay snapshot
  - added `LoadInventoryCacheSnapshot(cachePath)`
  - added `SyncRuntimeOverlayCache(cachePath, overlay)`
  - `saveInventoryCache(...)` now preserves existing persisted runtime overlay when refreshing the base inventory section
  - `SyncInventoryCacheFromLiveSources(...)` now preserves persisted runtime overlay while resyncing base live inventory from JSONC/DB
  - when no base inventory exists but persisted runtime overlay does, the cache file is retained instead of being deleted
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - local inventory views now load persisted runtime overlay from the canonical cache snapshot
  - fallback inventory views now distinguish:
    - persisted runtime overlay counts
    - live in-memory runtime overlay counts
  - persisted runtime overlay entries are surfaced with source `go-persisted-runtime-overlay`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - runtime server add/remove flows now call `syncRuntimeOverlayCache()` after updating the in-memory registry
  - this keeps the durable runtime overlay section of the cache aligned with runtime-registry mutations
- expanded `go/internal/mcp/inventory_test.go`
  - added regression coverage proving runtime overlay can persist without base inventory
  - added regression coverage proving overlay-only cache files are removed when overlay is cleared
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added fallback coverage proving persisted runtime overlay is visible without a live in-memory runtime registry
  - added bridge-metadata coverage for distinct persisted-vs-live overlay counts

### Durable subset rule
To stay truthful, this step persists only the durable subset of runtime overlay data:
- runtime servers with a non-empty normalized tool list

What is intentionally **not** durably persisted by this step:
- failed probe attempts without tool data
- transient runtime failure state as if it were authoritative inventory
- a full runtime lifecycle/session model

### Why this matters
This materially improves restart behavior for operator-facing fallback inventory without pretending the runtime registry is fully durable.

What is true now:
- successful runtime-probed tool metadata can survive process restart via the canonical cache file
- fallback responses can distinguish persisted runtime overlay from live in-memory runtime overlay
- base inventory resync and runtime overlay persistence now share the same cache file instead of living in disconnected stores

What is still not true yet:
- this is still not full durable lifecycle parity for runtime servers themselves
- persisted runtime overlay is a durable cache of discovered metadata, not a guarantee that the runtime server is currently alive or reconnectable
- runtime add/remove execution semantics and transport lifecycle ownership are still only partial

### Validation performed for this MCP runtime-overlay durability step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/mcp/inventory.go go/internal/mcp/inventory_test.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/mcp ./internal/httpapi
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted mcp tests passed
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP freshness-semantics step (per-layer age and stale heuristics)
The next refinement was to make cache-backed fallback truthfulness more precise by distinguishing freshness across different cache layers instead of treating the whole response as one freshness bucket.

### The ambiguity before this step
Before this step, fallback responses could already tell operators:
- the cache source
- whether persisted runtime overlay existed
- whether live runtime overlay existed

But they still could not clearly answer:
- how old the base live-synced inventory snapshot was
- how old the persisted runtime overlay snapshot was
- how old the current-process live runtime overlay was
- whether any of those layers were old enough to deserve caution

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - local inventory views now track:
    - `PersistedOverlayCheckedAt`
    - `LiveOverlayCheckedAt`
  - bridge metadata now exposes separate freshness fields for:
    - base inventory layer
    - persisted runtime overlay layer
    - live runtime overlay layer
- cache-backed bridge metadata now includes fields such as:
  - `baseInventoryCachedAt`
  - `baseInventoryAgeMs`
  - `baseInventoryStaleHeuristic`
  - `persistedOverlayCachedAt`
  - `persistedOverlayAgeMs`
  - `persistedOverlayStaleHeuristic`
  - `liveOverlayCachedAt`
  - `liveOverlayAgeMs`
  - `liveOverlayStaleHeuristic`
- heuristic thresholds are intentionally simple and truthful:
  - base inventory stale heuristic: older than 24 hours
  - persisted runtime overlay stale heuristic: older than 15 minutes
  - live runtime overlay stale heuristic: older than 15 minutes
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - cache-backed fallback tests now verify the new age/staleness metadata for:
    - base inventory cache
    - persisted runtime overlay
    - live runtime overlay

### Important truthfulness note
These are **heuristic** freshness signals, not assertions that data is invalid.

What is true now:
- operators can see per-layer cache age information
- operators can distinguish base inventory freshness from persisted overlay freshness from live overlay freshness
- stale heuristic flags are now explicit instead of implicit guesswork

What is not true yet:
- a stale heuristic does not mean the data is definitely wrong
- a non-stale heuristic does not guarantee the downstream server is currently healthy or reachable
- this is still observability/truthfulness improvement, not full lifecycle authority

### Validation performed for this MCP freshness-semantics step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP per-tool provenance step (origin layer + layer freshness on tool records)
The next refinement was to stop forcing clients to infer per-tool provenance from only the top-level bridge metadata.

### The ambiguity before this step
Before this step:
- bridge metadata could describe the freshness of base inventory, persisted runtime overlay, and live runtime overlay at a summary level
- but an individual tool record still did not directly say which layer it came from

That made it harder for dashboard/UI consumers to explain things like:
- why this specific tool is present
- whether this specific tool came from base inventory, persisted runtime overlay, or live runtime overlay
- which freshness timestamp/staleness heuristic actually applies to this specific tool

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - introduced per-tool layer metadata mapping via `inventoryToolLayerMeta(...)`
  - individual fallback tool records now carry fields such as:
    - `originLayer`
    - `layerCachedAt`
    - `layerAgeMs`
    - `layerStaleHeuristic`
- applied that per-tool metadata uniformly across:
  - `fallbackMCPInventoryTools(...)`
  - `fallbackSearchMCPInventoryTools(...)`
  - `fallbackControlToolsFromInventory(...)`
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - fallback tests now verify per-tool origin-layer fields for:
    - base inventory tools
    - persisted runtime overlay tools
    - live runtime overlay tools

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- each fallback tool record now states which origin layer it came from
- each fallback tool record now carries the freshness timestamp and stale heuristic for that specific layer
- consumers no longer need to guess per-tool provenance from only response-level summary metadata

What is still not true yet:
- per-tool provenance is still derived from the current cache/view model, not from a fully authoritative lifecycle ledger
- layer stale heuristics are still heuristics, not definitive correctness signals
- this improves inspectability, not full MCP lifecycle parity

### Validation performed for this MCP per-tool provenance step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up MCP server-level provenance step (runtime server origin layer + freshness)
The next refinement was to bring `/api/mcp/servers/runtime` up to the same truthfulness standard as the tool fallback surfaces.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- tool fallback records could explain their origin layer and layer freshness
- but runtime server fallback records still relied on a thinner summary model
- persisted runtime overlay could survive in cache, yet `/api/mcp/servers/runtime` did not surface that durable provenance cleanly when live summary detection was unavailable

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - local inventory views now retain runtime overlay records in addition to counts
  - added shared server-level provenance helpers
  - added `fallbackRuntimeServersWithProvenance(...)`
  - runtime server records now carry fields such as:
    - `originLayer`
    - `layerCachedAt`
    - `layerAgeMs`
    - `layerStaleHeuristic`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go`
  - `/api/mcp/servers/runtime` now uses the shared provenance-aware runtime server formatter
  - when summary detection is unavailable, the route can still recover from persisted/live runtime overlay cache data instead of dropping directly to service-unavailable
  - bridge metadata now stays aligned with the same cache/source/freshness model used elsewhere
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - summary-backed runtime server fallback now verifies `originLayer: "source-backed-summary"`
  - live runtime overlay runtime-server fallback now verifies server-level freshness fields
  - persisted runtime overlay runtime-server fallback now verifies recovery from cache without a live in-memory registry

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- runtime server fallback responses now carry server-level provenance and freshness metadata
- persisted runtime overlay can recover `/api/mcp/servers/runtime` when live summary detection is unavailable
- server-level and tool-level fallback truthfulness are now much more aligned

What is still not true yet:
- this does not make runtime server lifecycle fully durable or authoritative
- persisted runtime overlay still represents cached discovered metadata, not a promise that the runtime server is alive now
- full transport/session lifecycle parity remains incomplete

### Validation performed for this MCP server-level provenance step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up configured-server provenance step (record-level metadata origin and freshness)
The next truthfulness gap was on configured-server read surfaces.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- configured-server fallback routes could return `_meta` payloads
- but the server record itself did not directly state:
  - whether the definition came from JSONC fallback or DB-with-JSONC-overlay fallback
  - what the metadata source was
  - when the metadata was last hydrated/discovered
  - whether that metadata should be treated as old enough to warrant caution

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - JSONC-backed configured server records now include provenance fields such as:
    - `originLayer`
    - `metadataOrigin`
    - `metadataCachedAt`
    - `metadataAgeMs`
    - `metadataStaleHeuristic`
  - DB-backed configured server fallback records now include the same provenance/freshness fields after JSONC metadata overlay is applied
  - metadata provenance can infer `jsonc-cache` when cached tool metadata is clearly present even if older JSONC fixtures do not explicitly set `metadataSource`
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - configured server list/get fallback tests now verify the new provenance/freshness fields
  - the JSONC fixture now includes an explicit cache hydration timestamp to make freshness assertions deterministic

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- configured-server fallback records now say where the definition layer came from
- configured-server fallback records now expose metadata freshness/provenance directly on the record
- JSONC-backed and DB-backed configured server fallback payloads are more inspectable and more aligned with the tool/runtime provenance model

What is still not true yet:
- configured-server provenance still reflects fallback data authority, not full runtime liveness authority
- metadata staleness is still heuristic, not proof the metadata is invalid
- broader configured-server ecosystem parity is still incomplete

### Validation performed for this configured-server provenance step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up provenance-schema unification step (stable nested `provenance` object)
The next cleanup target was naming consistency.

### The inconsistency before this step
By this point, fallback records had become much more truthful, but the naming model was still mixed:
- `source`
- `originLayer`
- `metadataOrigin`
- `layerCachedAt`
- `metadataCachedAt`

That was workable for humans reading raw JSON, but not ideal for UI/API consumers trying to rely on one predictable provenance schema across all MCP fallback records.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - tool fallback records now expose a nested `provenance` object with fields like:
    - `layer`
    - `source`
    - `cachedAt`
    - `ageMs`
    - `staleHeuristic`
    - `cacheAuthority`
    - `metadataAuthority`
  - runtime server fallback records now use the same nested `provenance` object model
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - configured-server fallback records now also expose a nested `provenance` object while preserving the richer configured-server-specific metadata fields already present at the top level
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - fallback tests now verify the nested `provenance` object across:
    - tool fallback records
    - runtime server fallback records
    - configured-server fallback records

### Compatibility note
This step was intentionally additive.

What changed for consumers:
- there is now one stable nested `provenance` object to read across MCP fallback record types

What did **not** change yet:
- the legacy top-level fields remain present for compatibility
- this is a schema unification step, not a breaking rename/removal step

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- MCP fallback records now have a more uniform provenance schema
- clients can read one nested `provenance` object across tools, runtime servers, and configured servers
- the schema is more predictable without pretending old fields never existed

What is still not true yet:
- some legacy top-level provenance fields still remain alongside the nested object
- there is still not a single shared typed API contract across TS and Go for all these record shapes
- this improves consistency, not full end-state contract parity

### Validation performed for this provenance-schema unification step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up provenance-contract step (nested `provenance` marked primary)
The next cleanup was to make the intent of the new schema explicit instead of merely implicit.

### The ambiguity before this step
Before this step:
- fallback records already had the nested `provenance` object
- but clients still had no explicit signal about whether they should prefer:
  - the nested `provenance` object
  - or the older duplicated top-level provenance fields

That made the transition path less clear than it needed to be.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - nested `provenance` objects now explicitly include:
    - `schemaVersion: 1`
    - `primary: true`
    - `compatibilityMode: "legacy-top-level-mirrors-retained"`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - configured-server provenance now uses the same explicit primary nested provenance contract
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - tests now verify the explicit primary/compatibility markers inside nested `provenance`

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- the nested `provenance` object is now explicitly the primary fallback provenance contract
- legacy top-level provenance fields are still present, but now clearly framed as compatibility mirrors
- clients have a concrete migration target instead of only an implied preference

What is still not true yet:
- legacy top-level fields have not been removed yet
- TS and Go still do not share one single typed provenance contract everywhere
- this is a contract-clarification step, not final contract consolidation

### Validation performed for this provenance-contract step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up provenance-compatibility cleanup step (explicit legacy mirror list)
The next low-risk cleanup was to make compatibility mirroring explicit instead of merely implied.

### The ambiguity before this step
Before this step:
- the nested `provenance` object was marked primary
- but clients still had no explicit machine-readable list of which top-level fields were being retained only as compatibility mirrors

That meant the compatibility boundary was clear in docs, but not as explicit in the payload contract itself.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - nested `provenance` objects now carry `legacyMirrorFields`
  - tool/runtime-layer provenance now explicitly lists mirrored top-level fields such as:
    - `originLayer`
    - `layerCachedAt`
    - `layerAgeMs`
    - `layerStaleHeuristic`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - configured-server provenance now explicitly lists mirrored top-level fields such as:
    - `originLayer`
    - `metadataOrigin`
    - `metadataCachedAt`
    - `metadataAgeMs`
    - `metadataStaleHeuristic`
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - tests now verify `legacyMirrorFields` in the primary nested provenance contract

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- the payload itself now states exactly which top-level provenance fields are compatibility mirrors
- clients can reliably prioritize nested `provenance` while still understanding the compatibility surface
- the contract is clearer without yet breaking consumers

What is still not true yet:
- legacy mirror fields still remain in payloads
- this is still not final removal of duplicate provenance fields
- TS and Go contract consolidation is still incomplete

### Validation performed for this provenance-compatibility cleanup step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up low-risk provenance-trim step (search-result records)
The next cleanup step was to begin actually reducing duplicated top-level provenance fields, but only on the lowest-risk MCP fallback surfaces first.

### Why search results were chosen first
Search-result records are a good first candidate because they are:
- read-only
- transient/result-oriented
- less likely to be treated as long-lived object contracts than list/get payloads

That makes them a safer place to begin trimming duplicated provenance mirrors while preserving the nested `provenance` object as the primary contract.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - added `primaryProvenanceOnly(...)`
  - MCP/cache-backed **search result** records now:
    - keep the nested `provenance` object
    - switch `compatibilityMode` to `legacy-top-level-mirrors-trimmed`
    - clear `legacyMirrorFields`
    - drop top-level layer mirror fields such as:
      - `originLayer`
      - `layerCachedAt`
      - `layerAgeMs`
      - `layerStaleHeuristic`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - cache-backed `/api/tools/search` search results now also use the trimmed provenance-mirror form
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - search-result tests now verify:
    - nested `provenance` is present
    - compatibility mode is `legacy-top-level-mirrors-trimmed`
    - legacy mirror list is empty
    - trimmed top-level layer mirrors are absent from search-result payloads

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- search-result surfaces are the first MCP fallback records where legacy top-level provenance mirrors are actually being trimmed
- nested `provenance` remains the authoritative schema on those responses
- list/get surfaces still retain compatibility mirrors for now

What is still not true yet:
- top-level provenance duplication has not been removed across all fallback surfaces
- this is a selective low-risk migration step, not a global breaking contract change
- TS/Go contract consolidation is still incomplete

### Validation performed for this low-risk provenance-trim step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up low-risk provenance-trim step (tool list surfaces)
After search-result records were trimmed successfully, the next low-risk expansion was to apply the same contract cleanup to list-style tool surfaces while still leaving get/detail responses compatibility-heavy.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - `/api/mcp/tools` fallback tool list records now trim top-level layer mirror fields in favor of nested `provenance`
  - `/api/tools` and `/api/tools/by-server` cache-backed fallback tool list records now do the same
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - list/by-server cache-backed tool routes now use the trimmed list formatter
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - list-surface tests now verify:
    - nested `provenance` remains present
    - `compatibilityMode` is `legacy-top-level-mirrors-trimmed`
    - `legacyMirrorFields` is empty
    - top-level layer mirrors are absent from the trimmed list payloads

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- low-risk list surfaces now join search surfaces in preferring the nested `provenance` object over legacy top-level layer mirrors
- higher-risk get/detail/configured/runtime compatibility-heavy surfaces still retain their top-level mirrors for now

What is still not true yet:
- top-level provenance duplication is still not removed everywhere
- this remains a selective low-risk rollout, not a global contract break
- TS/Go contract consolidation is still incomplete

### Validation performed for this low-risk list-surface trim step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up low-risk provenance-trim step (runtime/configured server lists)
The next low-risk extension was to apply the same primary-provenance-only treatment to server **list** surfaces while still leaving server get/detail responses compatibility-heavy.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - runtime-server list records can now be emitted in primary-provenance-only form
  - configured-server records now also have a dedicated primary-provenance-only trim helper
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go`
  - `/api/mcp/servers/runtime` list responses now use the trimmed primary-provenance list form
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - `/api/mcp/servers/configured` list responses now use the trimmed primary-provenance list form
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - runtime-server list tests now verify:
    - nested `provenance` remains present
    - `compatibilityMode` is `legacy-top-level-mirrors-trimmed`
    - `legacyMirrorFields` is empty
    - top-level layer/metadata mirror fields are absent from the list response
  - configured-server list tests now verify the same trimmed contract

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- low-risk runtime/configured list surfaces now join tool search/list surfaces in preferring the primary nested `provenance` object
- get/detail payloads remain compatibility-heavy where contract risk is higher

What is still not true yet:
- top-level provenance duplication still remains on higher-risk detail surfaces
- this is still a selective contract migration, not a global breaking cleanup
- TS/Go contract consolidation remains incomplete

### Validation performed for this low-risk runtime/configured list trim step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/mcp_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up low-risk provenance-trim step (detail-adjacent `/api/tools/get`)
After trimming low-risk search/list surfaces, the next smallest detail-adjacent step was to move `/api/tools/get` onto the primary nested provenance contract while still leaving higher-risk configured/detail server surfaces compatibility-heavy.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - added `fallbackControlToolPrimaryProvenance(...)`
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - `/api/tools/get` cache-backed fallback now returns the primary nested provenance form rather than the compatibility-heavy mirrored form
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - `/api/tools/get` fallback test now verifies:
    - nested `provenance` remains present
    - `compatibilityMode` is `legacy-top-level-mirrors-trimmed`
    - `legacyMirrorFields` is empty
    - top-level layer mirrors are absent from this detail-adjacent payload

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- `/api/tools/get` is the first detail-adjacent MCP fallback surface to adopt the trimmed primary-provenance form
- configured-server and other higher-risk detail surfaces still preserve compatibility mirrors for now

What is still not true yet:
- this is still a selective migration, not global detail-surface cleanup
- many higher-risk get/detail/config surfaces still retain top-level provenance duplication for compatibility
- TS/Go contract consolidation remains incomplete

### Validation performed for this detail-adjacent provenance-trim step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up detail-adjacent provenance-trim step (configured-server get)
The next step after `/api/tools/get` was to trim the next remaining detail-style MCP fallback read that had become low enough risk: configured-server get fallback.

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - JSONC-backed configured-server get fallback now returns the primary nested provenance form
  - DB-backed configured-server get fallback now does the same
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go`
  - configured-server primary-provenance-only trimming helper is now used by both list and get fallback responses
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - configured-server get fallback test now verifies:
    - nested `provenance` remains present
    - `compatibilityMode` is `legacy-top-level-mirrors-trimmed`
    - `legacyMirrorFields` is empty
    - top-level configured-server metadata mirror fields are absent from the get response

### Important truthfulness note
What is true now:
- configured-server get fallback now joins search/list surfaces and `/api/tools/get` in preferring the primary nested provenance contract
- the migration still remains selective rather than repo-wide

What is still not true yet:
- some higher-risk config/detail surfaces still retain compatibility-heavy top-level mirrors
- full TS/Go contract consolidation is still incomplete
- this is still not a global breaking cleanup

### Validation performed for this configured-server get trim step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/mcp_inventory_fallback.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go-primary backend slice (native skills assimilation fallback)
The next higher-leverage move after the MCP provenance cleanup was to replace a real TS-only backend behavior with native Go ownership where the repo already had enough local primitives to do something useful and truthful.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- `/api/skills/assimilate` was still bridge-only to TypeScript
- Go already had native local skill scanning/reading/creating/saving primitives
- but Go could not own even a basic fallback assimilation path when TS was unavailable

### What changed
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - `/api/skills/assimilate` now uses `handleSkillMutation(...)` like other skill mutations instead of being bridge-only
  - added `localAssimilateSkill(...)`
- native Go assimilation fallback now:
  - validates the requested topic
  - derives a safe local skill ID
  - creates a real local skill scaffold under `.hypercode/skills/<id>/SKILL.md`
  - records the requested topic
  - records the optional docs URL
  - logs clearly that this is a native Go fallback scaffold, not a fully researched TS/LLM assimilation output
  - returns structured success/log output instead of only failing when TS is unavailable
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added regression coverage proving:
    - `/api/skills/assimilate` falls back locally when upstream is unavailable
    - a real `SKILL.md` scaffold is written
    - the scaffold preserves topic/docs URL context

### Important truthfulness note
This is a **real Go-native fallback**, but it is not full TS feature parity.

What is true now:
- `/api/skills/assimilate` is no longer bridge-only
- Go can create a real local starter skill scaffold when TS is unavailable
- the fallback is explicit about its limitations and does not pretend to be a full research/LLM assimilation pipeline

What is still not true yet:
- this is not full Darwin/LLM/research-driven assimilation parity
- the Go fallback does not yet replicate DeepResearch + LLM code-generation behavior from TS
- richer autonomous skill generation remains incomplete in Go

### Validation performed for this native skills-assimilation step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go-primary backend slice (native Darwin fallback)
The next real TS-to-Go backend ownership step was to replace Darwin’s bridge-only status with a truthful native fallback instead of leaving those routes completely TypeScript-owned.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- `/api/darwin/evolve`
- `/api/darwin/experiment`
- `/api/darwin/status`
were all bridge-only to TypeScript

That meant Go had no native Darwin ownership at all, even for local mutation/experiment state when TS was unavailable.

### What changed
- added `go/internal/httpapi/darwin_local_state.go`
  - native local Darwin mutation state
  - native local Darwin experiment state
  - persisted Darwin state under Go config dir (`darwin_state.json`)
  - async local experiment completion with deterministic, truthful local heuristics
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - server now owns `darwinState`
- replaced `go/internal/httpapi/darwin_handlers.go`
  - Darwin routes now attempt TS first, then fall back natively in Go
  - `/api/darwin/evolve` now creates a native local mutation scaffold
  - `/api/darwin/experiment` now creates and runs a native local experiment record
  - `/api/darwin/status` now reports native local Darwin state
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added regression coverage proving native Darwin fallback works end-to-end when upstream is unavailable
  - preserved existing upstream bridge coverage

### Important truthfulness note
This is a **real Go-native Darwin fallback**, but it is not full TS parity.

What is true now:
- Darwin routes are no longer bridge-only
- Go can persist local Darwin mutations and experiments
- Go can run a deterministic local fallback experiment flow and report status truthfully
- Darwin fallback state survives restart through `darwin_state.json`

What is still not true yet:
- this does not replicate TS LLM-driven mutation generation and judging parity
- the local Darwin fallback uses deterministic local heuristics instead of live model-based evolutionary evaluation
- full Darwin/autodev/swarm parity in Go remains incomplete

### Validation performed for this native Darwin step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/darwin_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/darwin_local_state.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go-primary backend slice (native AutoDev fallback)
The next real TS-to-Go backend ownership step was AutoDev.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- `/api/autodev/start-loop`
- `/api/autodev/cancel-loop`
- `/api/autodev/loops`
- `/api/autodev/loop`
- `/api/autodev/clear-completed`
were still bridge-only to TypeScript

That meant Go could not own even a basic local fix-loop manager when TS was unavailable.

### What changed
- added `go/internal/httpapi/autodev_local_state.go`
  - native local AutoDev loop state
  - persisted AutoDev state under Go config dir (`autodev_state.json`)
  - async loop execution with retry tracking
  - local cancel/list/get/clear behavior
  - truthful no-director/no-process-kill semantics in fallback mode
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - server now owns `autoDevState`
- replaced `go/internal/httpapi/autodev_handlers.go`
  - AutoDev routes now attempt TS first, then fall back natively in Go
  - local fallback supports:
    - start loop
    - cancel loop
    - list loops
    - get one loop
    - clear completed loops
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added regression coverage proving native AutoDev fallback works with a harmless custom command when upstream is unavailable
  - preserved existing upstream bridge coverage

### Important truthfulness note
This is a **real Go-native AutoDev fallback**, but it is not full TS parity.

What is true now:
- AutoDev routes are no longer bridge-only
- Go can persist local AutoDev loop state and report it across requests/restarts
- Go can execute simple local retry loops truthfully in fallback mode
- Go does not kill in-flight processes during cancel; it only prevents further retries

What is still not true yet:
- this does not replicate TS director-driven autonomous repair parity
- the Go fallback does not yet perform the richer Director/agent-mediated code-fix loop from TS
- full autodev/swarm/squad orchestration parity remains incomplete

### Validation performed for this native AutoDev step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/autodev_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/autodev_local_state.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go-primary backend slice (native squad fallback)
The next orchestration-heavy backend family to pull out of bridge-only status was squad.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- `/api/squad`
- `/api/squad/spawn`
- `/api/squad/kill`
- `/api/squad/chat`
- `/api/squad/indexer/toggle`
- `/api/squad/indexer/status`
were still bridge-only to TypeScript

That meant Go could not own even basic persisted local squad/indexer state when TS was unavailable.

### What changed
- added `go/internal/httpapi/squad_local_state.go`
  - native persisted squad member state
  - native persisted squad indexer toggle/status state
  - local squad “brain” snapshots with goal/history/message state
  - persisted squad state under Go config dir (`squad_state.json`)
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - server now owns `squadState`
- replaced `go/internal/httpapi/squad_handlers.go`
  - squad routes now attempt TS first, then fall back natively in Go
  - local fallback supports:
    - list
    - spawn
    - kill
    - chat
    - indexer toggle
    - indexer status
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added regression coverage proving native squad fallback works end-to-end when upstream is unavailable
  - preserved existing upstream bridge coverage

### Important truthfulness note
This is a **real Go-native squad fallback**, but it is not full TS parity.

What is true now:
- squad routes are no longer bridge-only
- Go can persist local squad member/indexer state and report it across requests/restarts
- Go can maintain simple local squad “brain” state for messages/goals/status

What is still not true yet:
- this does not replicate TS worktree creation, Director execution, or richer squad autonomy parity
- the Go fallback does not yet own the full squad worktree/director lifecycle
- full swarm/squad orchestration parity remains incomplete

### Validation performed for this native squad step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/squad_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/squad_local_state.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

## Follow-up Go-primary backend slice (native swarm fallback for safest surfaces)
The next orchestration-heavy backend family was swarm, but approached selectively instead of pretending to solve full swarm parity in one pass.

### The gap before this step
Before this step:
- all swarm routes were effectively bridge-only to TypeScript
- Go had no native mission history/risk view or local mission start/resume fallback at all

### What changed
- added `go/internal/httpapi/swarm_local_state.go`
  - native persisted swarm mission state under Go config dir (`swarm_state.json`)
  - native mission scaffolding
  - native mission history
  - native mission risk summary/rows/facets
  - native mesh capability snapshot
- updated `go/internal/httpapi/server.go`
  - server now owns `swarmState`
- replaced `go/internal/httpapi/swarm_handlers.go`
  - the safest swarm surfaces now attempt TS first, then fall back natively in Go:
    - start mission
    - resume mission
    - mission history
    - mission risk summary
    - mission risk rows
    - mission risk facets
    - mesh capabilities
  - higher-risk mutation/orchestration routes still remain bridge-first:
    - approve task
    - decompose task
    - update task priority
    - debate
    - consensus
    - direct message
- expanded `go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go`
  - added regression coverage proving native swarm fallback works end-to-end for the supported local mission/risk surfaces
  - preserved existing upstream bridge coverage

### Important truthfulness note
This is a **real Go-native swarm fallback slice**, but not full swarm parity.

What is true now:
- Go can start and persist a local swarm mission scaffold
- Go can resume local swarm missions
- Go can serve local mission history and mission-risk analytics when TS is unavailable
- Go can serve a local mesh capability snapshot

What is still not true yet:
- this does not replicate full TS swarm orchestration parity
- task approval/decomposition, debate, consensus, and direct messaging are still bridge-first
- the local mission scaffold is a truthful fallback representation, not a full multi-agent orchestration engine parity replacement

### Validation performed for this native swarm step
```bash
gofmt -w go/internal/httpapi/swarm_handlers.go go/internal/httpapi/swarm_local_state.go go/internal/httpapi/server.go go/internal/httpapi/server_test.go
cd go && go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/mcp
cd go && go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/hypercode
cd go && go test ./...
```

Results:
- targeted httpapi tests passed
- targeted mcp tests passed
- Go build passed
- full Go suite passed

### Follow-up swarm expansion note
After the initial swarm slice landed, the native fallback scope was expanded beyond just mission start/resume/history/risk/mesh reads.

The local swarm fallback now also covers:
- approve task
- decompose task
- update task priority
- local debate heuristic
- local consensus heuristic
- direct-message acknowledgment

Truthfulness note:
- these are still deterministic local fallback semantics, not full TS swarm-orchestrator parity
- they are real local backend ownership, but not a claim of full multi-agent execution equivalence

## Bottom line
This pass meaningfully strengthened the **Go-primary migration path** and improved TypeScript survivability while the migration continues:
- broader provider routing
- native workflows
- native supervisor endpoints
- native export
- native submodule update orchestration
- detached async execution for workflow/supervisor request lifecycles
- regression tests for the new native surfaces
- repaired bridge-first behavior for key memory/MCP/council routes
- graceful empty-result fallback for missing local memory DB state
- hardened native git submodule parsing and fallback reporting
- regression coverage for MCP inventory/ranking and provider selection behavior
- regression coverage for supervisor lifecycle basics and session export generation
- regression coverage for council debate orchestration and BobbyBookmarks sync
- deduplicated provider alias reporting for configured native providers
- truthful CLI startup reuse when HyperCode is already running on port 4000
- OpenRouter free as the new default for quota-sensitive TS services
- session-import startup no longer aborts when imported instruction docs hit SQLite-unavailable state
- auto-import background failures now degrade truthfully instead of risking unhandled async startup noise
- concise once-per-surface SQLite degraded-mode logging for more startup-time ingestion paths
- explicit Go-primary migration planning artifacts
- Go-primary runtime selection in the CLI launcher (`auto|go|node`, with auto preferring Go)
- truthful dashboard skipping/warnings when Go runtime is selected but TS/tRPC compatibility is still required for the current web UI
- native Go links backlog crawling/enrichment API surface
- Go-owned links backlog crawler background lifecycle in the Go server
- native imported-session persistence, dedup, memory-row storage, docs generation, and maintenance stats in Go
- Go read fallbacks for imported sessions now prefer persistent local state before archive-only/scan-only degradation
- native Go debate-history persistence plus native council-history read/write fallbacks
- native fallback council debates now persist into Go history instead of being transient-only
- native file-based imported-session ingest in Go with heuristic memory extraction and instruction-doc regeneration
- native DB-backed imported-session parsing in Go for `llm-cli` and Prism artifacts
- MCP configured-server reads and writes now share JSONC as the native local authority in Go fallback mode
- native MCP metadata refresh/cache endpoints now use truthful JSONC inspection semantics instead of a generic placeholder-only state
- native MCP stdio metadata refresh can now perform live `tools/list` probing for probeable configured servers
- native MCP runtime add/remove/list fallback now uses a real Go runtime registry instead of only config-shaped behavior
- native MCP fallback mode now has persisted local working-set state, eviction history, and tool-selection telemetry via Go-owned `mcp_state.json`
- native MCP inventory now has a Go-owned persisted cache layer via `mcp_inventory_cache.json`, and key MCP/control tool list/search fallbacks can recover from it
- cache-backed MCP/control fallback responses now expose source/freshness metadata and can overlay runtime-registry live-probed tools into the operator-visible fallback inventory view
- JSONC metadata save/mutation flows now actively resync `mcp_inventory_cache.json` from live sources so metadata clear/refresh actions do not preserve stale cached tool inventory
- canonical MCP metadata-tool normalization is now shared between JSONC metadata handling, inventory-cache generation, runtime overlay inventory views, and live metadata refresh serialization
- the canonical MCP cache file now persists the durable subset of successful runtime overlay tool metadata and fallback responses distinguish persisted-vs-live runtime overlay counts
- cache-backed fallback responses now expose per-layer age and stale heuristics for base inventory, persisted runtime overlay, and live runtime overlay
- individual fallback tool records now carry origin-layer and layer freshness metadata so clients can explain per-tool provenance directly
- runtime server fallback records now also carry server-level origin-layer and layer freshness metadata, and can recover from persisted runtime overlay cache when live summary detection is unavailable
- configured-server fallback records now carry record-level definition-layer provenance plus metadata freshness/provenance fields across JSONC-backed and DB-backed fallback reads
- MCP fallback records now expose a stable nested `provenance` object across tools, runtime servers, and configured servers, and that nested object is now explicitly marked as the primary contract while legacy top-level fields remain as compatibility mirrors
- nested `provenance` now explicitly lists its `legacyMirrorFields`, making the compatibility boundary machine-readable as well as documented
- low-risk search-result fallback surfaces are now the first places where redundant top-level provenance mirrors have actually been trimmed in favor of the primary nested `provenance` contract
- low-risk tool list surfaces now join search surfaces in trimming redundant top-level provenance mirrors while higher-risk get/detail surfaces remain intact for now
- low-risk runtime/configured server list surfaces now also use the trimmed primary nested `provenance` contract while corresponding get/detail responses remain compatibility-heavy for now
- `/api/tools/get` is now the first detail-adjacent MCP fallback surface to adopt the trimmed primary nested `provenance` contract while higher-risk detail surfaces remain compatibility-heavy
- configured-server get fallback now also adopts the trimmed primary nested `provenance` contract while the remaining highest-risk config/detail surfaces stay compatibility-heavy for now
- `/api/skills/assimilate` now has a native Go fallback that writes a real local starter skill scaffold instead of remaining bridge-only
- Darwin routes now have a native Go persisted local fallback for mutation/experiment/status behavior instead of remaining bridge-only
- AutoDev routes now have a native Go persisted local loop-manager fallback instead of remaining bridge-only
- squad routes now have a native Go persisted local squad/indexer state fallback instead of remaining bridge-only
- the safest swarm mission/risk/mesh surfaces plus mission start/resume now have native Go persisted fallback ownership instead of remaining bridge-only
- native swarm fallback now also covers local approve/decompose/update/debate/consensus/direct-message semantics, while remaining truthful that these are fallback heuristics rather than full orchestrator parity
- a tested Go-native replacement path for multiple TS-owned persistence surfaces, even though mixed-runtime cleanup is not fully finished yet
- a small but real Maestro UX fix

It was validated by successful Go compilation, successful targeted Go tests for the new native surfaces, successful targeted regression tests for repaired bridge/fallback routes, a successful full Go test suite run (`go test ./...`), targeted CLI startup tests and type-checking, council/sync coverage, targeted AI/core validation, and repeated successful workspace builds. The new systems are real and integrated, but several of them should still be described as **Beta** or **Experimental**, not full parity.
