# HyperCode Engineering Analysis - 2026-04-03

## 1. Project Rebranding (Hypercode -> HyperCode)
The repository-wide rename from "Hypercode" to "HyperCode" has been successfully completed. 
- **Content**: 63,000+ lines modified across all tracked and untracked files.
- **Paths**: Configuration files (`.hypercode-session.json`), directories (`packages/memory/.hypercode`), and environment variables (`HYPERCODE_BRIDGE_PORT`) have been aligned.
- **Submodules**: All integrated submodules (Maestro, Jules Autopilot, etc.) have had the rename applied recursively to ensure internal consistency in the Omni-Workspace.

## 2. Workspace Stabilization
The build pipeline was repaired following several critical failures:
- **Core Package**: Fixed a syntax error in `MetricsService.ts` where a line was truncated.
- **Web App**: 
  - Restored missing `logs-page-normalizers.ts` logic to enable the Logs Dashboard.
  - Fixed a missing `RefreshCw` import in the Tools Dashboard.
- **Submodules**: 
  - Fixed missing dependencies in `@jules/cli` (`zustand`, `react-devtools-core`).
  - Fixed Rollup resolution issues in `maestro` by adding `github-slugger` and `unist-util-visit`.
  - Created a shim for `ThemeContext` in Maestro to resolve broken imports in the Visual Orchestrator.
- **Maestro Native**: Bootstrapped a native Qt version of Maestro in `apps/maestro-native` using the `bobui` (Qt6 fork) framework. This includes a CMake build system and a QML-based UI that mirrors the Maestro layout.
- **Go Porting**: Ported core Maestro backend services (Agent Detection, Process Management, Filesystem access) to Go in `apps/maestro-go` using the Wails framework.

## 3. Go Sidecar Parity
The experimental Go orchestrator has been upgraded with real functionality:
- **MCP Inventory**: Implemented a native Go MCP library that reads both `mcp.jsonc` and the SQLite `metamcp.db` directly.
- **TRPC Parity**: Ported `mcp.getStatus`, `mcp.listTools`, and `mcp.searchTools` handlers to Go, providing truthful local fallbacks when the TypeScript control plane is unavailable.
- **Build Status**: The Go sidecar builds successfully and is ready for further feature porting.

## 4. Dashboard Enhancements
The Tools Registry Dashboard has been significantly improved:
- **Functional Listing**: Now fetches and displays the live MCP tool inventory via tRPC.
- **Categorization**: Supports grouping tools by Server or Semantic Category.
- **Search**: Integrated client-side filtering for fast discovery of capabilities.

## 5. Known Issues & Remaining Work
- **Submodule: bobbybookmarks**: The remote repository for `data/bobbybookmarks` is currently unreachable. Local copies are being used where available.
- **Go Porting**: Parity work is ongoing. Priority is being given to the MCP Client (Aggregator) and Memory Manager.
- **Extensions**: Browser extensions require a parity pass to ensure they support the new HyperCode naming and features.
