## Definition of done for the new north star

Borg is ready for this mission when it can reliably:

- ingest public MCP server listings,
- deduplicate and normalize them,
- generate a realistic config recipe,
- test the recipe,
- classify the result,
- save the outcome to the database,
- and expose the full truth in the dashboard.
