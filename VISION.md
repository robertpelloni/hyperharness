# VISION.md - Borg: The Neural Operating System

> **Version**: 2.6.2 | **Codename**: AIOS (AI Operating System)
> **Tagline**: *"The Ultimate AI Tool Dashboard & Development Orchestrator"*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Borg is an all-in-one AI development platform that unifies every aspect of AI-assisted software development into a single, cohesive system. It combines an MCP router/aggregator, multi-model AI coding harness, universal memory system, agent orchestrator, provider manager, session controller, and full-featured WebUI dashboard — all extensible through a plugin architecture.

The core philosophy: **Why choose between competing tools when you can assimilate the best features from ALL of them?**

Borg achieves feature parity with — and ultimately surpasses — every major AI coding CLI (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Goose, Copilot CLI, Crush, CodeBuff, Kilo Code, Qwen Code, Warp CLI, Trae CLI), every MCP management tool (MetaMCP, MCPHub, PluggedIn, MCP-Proxy), every memory system (mem0, Supermemory, Letta, Zep, MemoryOS, Cognee), and every agent framework (OpenHands, AutoGen, Magentic-UI, Claude Squad).

## 2. Core Vision Pillars

### 2.1 MCP Router / Aggregator — The Ultimate MCP Hub

The MCP subsystem is the nervous system of Borg. It acts as both an MCP **client** (consuming tools from many servers) and an MCP **server** (presenting a unified "master" MCP to external consumers like Claude, Cursor, VS Code, etc.).

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Multi-Server Aggregation**: Combine 100+ MCP servers into one master interface
- **Namespace Isolation**: Group servers and tools into logical namespaces (e.g., `code.*`, `memory.*`, `browser.*`)
- **Session Management**: Handle MCP session lifecycle — auto-start, restart on crash, keep-alive heartbeat, timeout management
- **Single-Instance Multi-Client**: One running instance serves multiple AI clients simultaneously without duplication
- **Traffic Inspection**: Real-time MCP message inspector showing all JSON-RPC traffic with latency, direction, method, params, and results
- **Tool Reranking**: Automatically reorder tools by relevance, usage frequency, and semantic similarity to current task
- **Semantic Tool Search**: Find tools by natural language description, not just name
- **Progressive Tool Disclosure**: Start with essential tools, dynamically load more as needed to minimize context usage
- **Tool RAG**: Retrieve tools from a large registry using embedding-based search
- **TOON Format**: Tool-Optimized Output Notation for minimal-context tool descriptions
- **Code Mode**: Represent tools as callable code functions instead of JSON schema
- **Tool Renaming**: Automatically rename tools to minimize context tokens while preserving clarity
- **Tool Chaining**: Define and execute multi-tool workflows as single operations
- **MCP Directory**: Built-in directory of available MCP servers with ratings, categories, and one-click install
- **Auto-Install**: Automatically install MCP servers from npm, pip, or GitHub
- **Config Sync**: Auto-detect and write MCP configs for Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, and custom clients
- **Import/Export**: Full MCP configuration import/export in JSON/JSONC format
- **Proxy Capabilities**: stdio↔remote, SSE↔streamable-HTTP, any transport conversion
- **Auth Management**: Handle OAuth 2.0, bearer tokens, API keys per MCP server
- **Health Monitoring**: Per-server latency tracking, error rates, memory usage, auto-restart on failure
- **Environment Variables**: Per-server env var management, .env file support, secret injection

### 2.2 AI Coding Harness — Feature Parity With All CLI Tools

### 2.3 Memory System — Universal, Multi-Backend, Intelligent

Memory is Borg's long-term brain. It supports multiple storage backends simultaneously, with automatic harvesting, pruning, and retrieval.

**Storage Backends (Plugin-Based, Selectable/Combinable):**
- File-based (Markdown, JSON)
- SQLite (local, fast)
- PostgreSQL (scalable, shared)
- ChromaDB (vector embeddings)
- Qdrant (high-performance vectors)
- pgvector (Postgres + vectors)
- mem0 (structured memory)
- Supermemory (cloud memory)
- Letta (agent memory)
- Zep (conversation memory)
- Custom backend plugins

**Memory Types:**
- **Short-term**: Current session context, recent messages
- **Medium-term**: Cross-session project knowledge, recent decisions
- **Long-term**: Persistent knowledge, user preferences, learned patterns
- **Episodic**: Timestamped event memories
- **Semantic**: Concept and knowledge graph
- **Procedural**: How-to and workflow memories

**Intelligent Features:**
- Automatic context harvesting: Extract key info from conversations
- Smart pruning: Remove redundant/outdated memories
- Reranking: Prioritize relevant memories for current context
- Semantic search: Find memories by meaning, not just keywords
- Import/Export: Convert between any memory format
- Auto-detection: Find and import memories from other tools
- Browser integration: Store memories from web browsing
- Embedding-based retrieval with configurable models
- Memory visualization dashboard

### 2.4 Agent Orchestrator — Multi-Model Intelligence

Borg orchestrates multiple AI models working together, each with specialized roles.

**Orchestration Patterns:**
- **Director/Council/Supervisor**: A Director agent oversees development, consulting a Council of diverse models for decisions, with a Supervisor ensuring quality
- **Architect-Implementer**: One model plans, another implements
- **Multi-Model Debate**: Multiple models discuss a problem from different perspectives
- **Consensus Protocol**: Models vote on decisions (majority, unanimous, weighted, debate format)
- **Pair Programming**: Two models collaboratively write code
- **Swarm**: Multiple lightweight agents tackle independent subtasks

**Agent Capabilities:**
- Spawn agents from any provider/model
- Agent definitions library with pre-configured personas
- Per-agent system prompts, temperature, tool access
- Inter-agent communication via shared context
- Agent session isolation and resource management
- Fallback chains: When one model hits quota, seamlessly switch to next
- Cost tracking per agent

### 2.5 Provider Management — Intelligent, Quota-Aware

**Provider Features:**
- Configure multiple providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, OpenRouter, Copilot, Antigravity, local
- OAuth login for subscription services: Claude Max/Pro, Google AI Plus, Copilot Premium Plus, ChatGPT Plus, OpenCode Black
- API key management with encryption
- Per-provider quota tracking with visual dashboards
- **Automatic Fallback**: When one provider's quota is exhausted, automatically switch to the next best model
- **Smart Selection**: Choose models based on task type, cost, speed, quota remaining
- **Billing Dashboard**: Real-time usage, cost projections, reset dates
- **Free Tier Optimization**: Maximize usage of free tiers across providers (OpenCode, Cursor, Kilo Code, Windsurf, OpenRouter, Copilot)

### 2.6 Session Management — Never Lose Progress

**Session Features:**
- Track all development sessions with full history

## 5. Design Philosophy

1. **Assimilate, Don't Replicate**: Every referenced tool's best features are integrated, not just copied
2. **Plugin-First**: Each subsystem works standalone AND as part of the whole
3. **Context Efficiency**: Minimize token usage through TOON format, progressive disclosure, smart pruning
4. **Fail Gracefully**: Worker isolation, auto-restart, fallback chains — the system never fully crashes
5. **Document Everything**: Every feature has JSDoc, CLI help, UI tooltips, and manual documentation
6. **Single Source of Truth**: One VERSION.md, one config system, one memory store accessed many ways
7. **Submodule as Reference**: 200+ submodules provide reference implementations, not runtime dependencies
