---

## Session Update — 2026-02-22 (Release Gate Integration)

### Completed in this session
1. **Strict machine-readable release gate added**
   - Added `scripts/check_release_gate.mjs`.
   - Added root script: `pnpm run check:release-gate`.
   - Gate enforces three sequential checks:
     - strict readiness JSON pass (`scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs --strict-json`),
     - placeholder regression scan (`check:placeholders`),
     - core typecheck (`pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit`).

2. **Readiness checker strict JSON mode**
   - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with `--strict-json`.
   - `--strict-json` forces compact machine-consumable JSON output while preserving strict failure semantics.

3. **Release metadata synchronization**
   - Bumped canonical version to `2.7.4` in:
     - `VERSION`
     - `VERSION.md`
     - root `package.json`
   - Added `2.7.4` release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Updated `ROADMAP.md` Phase 64 checklist to include the completed strict release gate milestone.

### Verification snapshot
- `node scripts/check_release_gate.mjs` → passing (all checks passed).

---

## Session Update — 2026-02-22 (Dev Stability + Readiness Tooling)

### Completed in this session
1. **Web dev dist stability hardening**
   - `apps/web/scripts/dev.mjs` now uses stable `NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-dev` (instead of per-port dirs) to reduce tsconfig include churn/regression risk.
   - `apps/web/scripts/dev-auto.mjs` aligned to the same stable dev dist strategy.
   - `apps/web/tsconfig.json` normalized to retain stable `.next-dev` include globs and remove stale explicit per-port entries.

2. **OpenCode Autopilot server dev resilience**
   - `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/scripts/dev-auto.mjs` enhanced with deterministic port preflight diagnostics.
   - `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/src/index.ts` now includes runtime `Bun.serve` fallback handling for `EADDRINUSE` race conditions.
   - `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/tsconfig.json` fixed (`types: ["bun"]`) restoring package-level typecheck.

3. **New cross-service readiness check feature**
   - Added `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` to verify local dev critical endpoints across:
     - Borg Web
     - MetaMCP Frontend
     - MetaMCP Backend
     - OpenCode Autopilot Server
   - Added root script: `pnpm run check:dev-readiness`.
   - Supports `--soft` mode for non-blocking diagnostics while preserving strict-mode failure semantics.
   - Extended with `--json` mode for machine-readable output for CI/dashboard ingestion.
   - Extended with retry/backoff tolerance (`READINESS_RETRIES`, `READINESS_RETRY_DELAY_MS`) to reduce startup-race false negatives.

4. **MetaMCP backend JSON-only startup hardening**
   - In `external/MetaMCP/apps/backend/src/lib/mcp-config.service.ts`, DB import migration now short-circuits in intentional JSON-only mode.
   - This removes misleading startup ERROR noise for expected no-DB local dev workflows.
   - Commit created in MetaMCP repo: `8215dbf` on branch `fix/json-only-db-import-skip` (push to MetaMCP `main` was blocked by remote divergence).

### Verification snapshot
- `pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit` → passing in current session.
- `pnpm -C packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server run typecheck` → passing after Bun typings fix.
- Root `pnpm run dev` observed stable startup with all major watch tasks launched and both Borg Web + MetaMCP frontend ready in earlier run output.

### Known remaining work
- Readiness checker currently emits text output only (no JSON mode yet).
- Strict readiness pass should be re-run while all critical services are intentionally up to gate release.
- Full release docs freeze + final E2E regression remain open under Phase 64.

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Canonical Version:** 2.7.3 (`VERSION.md`)  
**Primary Phase:** 64 — Release Readiness (Phase 67 MetaMCP Assimilation Complete)

## What was completed in this cycle

1. **Watch-mode stability fix (developer UX):**
   - Updated `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/shared/package.json`
     - `dev`: `tsc --watch` → `tsc --watch --preserveWatchOutput`
   - Updated `packages/claude-mem/gemini-cli-extension/package.json`
     - `dev`: `tsc --watch` → `tsc --watch --preserveWatchOutput`
   - Result: active TypeScript watchers no longer clear terminal history during monorepo `dev` runs.

2. **Canonical governance synchronization pass:**
   - Updated `VERSION.md` to `2.6.3`.
   - Added release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` for the watcher fix + doc synchronization.
   - Reconciled roadmap/todo/handoff language to match actual current state.

3. **Submodule governance refresh:**
   - Replaced stale sample content in `docs/SUBMODULE_DASHBOARD.md`.
   - Established explicit contract: `SUBMODULES.md` is inventory source of truth; dashboard doc remains concise governance layer.

4. **Backend service exposure pass (Phase 63 P3):**
    - Added new `browserRouter` (`packages/core/src/routers/browserRouter.ts`) with:
       - `status`
       - `closePage`
       - `closeAll`
    - Added new `meshRouter` (`packages/core/src/routers/meshRouter.ts`) with:
       - `status`
       - `broadcast`
    - Wired both routers into `appRouter` in `packages/core/src/trpc.ts`.
    - Added typed helper accessors in `packages/core/src/lib/trpc-core.ts`:
       - `getBrowserService()`
       - `getMeshService()`
    - Added runtime status helpers:
       - `BrowserService.getStatus()`
       - `MeshService.getPeerIds()` / `MeshService.getStatus()`

5. **Dashboard runtime exposure (MCP System):**
    - Updated `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/mcp/system/page.tsx` to consume live:
       - `trpc.browser.status`
       - `trpc.mesh.status`
    - Added operator actions in UI:
       - `trpc.browser.closeAll`
       - `trpc.mesh.broadcast` (heartbeat)
    - Added Browser/Mesh runtime cards and health-row visibility in the system dashboard.

6. **Runtime endpoint resilience pass (Dashboard + shared UI):**
    - Fixed numeric depth input handling in `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/research/page.tsx` to prevent `NaN` value propagation.
    - Removed `ChroniclePage` update loop by replacing stateful merge effect with memoized timeline derivation.
    - Added same-origin tRPC API route in `apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` and updated `apps/web/src/utils/TRPCProvider.tsx` fallback URL resolution to `/api/trpc`.
    - Hardened websocket clients with configurable URLs + bounded reconnect behavior:
       - `apps/web/src/components/TrafficInspector.tsx`
       - `apps/web/src/components/MirrorView.tsx`
       - `packages/ui/src/components/ResearchPanel.tsx`
       - `packages/ui/src/components/CouncilDebateWidget.tsx`
    - Updated remaining UI endpoint displays/fallbacks for host-aware defaults:
       - `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/inspector/page.tsx`
       - `packages/ui/src/app/cli-dashboard/page.tsx`
    - Centralized endpoint resolution into shared helper module:
       - `packages/ui/src/lib/endpoints.ts`
       - exported via `packages/ui/src/index.tsx`
    - Migrated endpoint consumers to shared utilities to reduce drift and duplicated URL logic across app/ui surfaces.
    - Added shared reconnect/input policy helper module:
       - `packages/ui/src/lib/connection-policy.ts`
       - exported via `packages/ui/src/index.tsx`
    - Migrated websocket widgets to shared policy-driven reconnection (bounded attempts + backoff) and shared numeric input normalization helpers.

7. **Backend realism closure pass (P0, major):**
    - Replaced simulated saved-script execution in `packages/core/src/routers/savedScriptsRouter.ts` with real `CodeExecutorService` execution + structured run metadata.
    - Implemented real token exchange flow in `packages/core/src/routers/oauthRouter.ts`:
       - state parsing (UUID or structured JSON),
       - pending session/client validation,
       - provider token endpoint POST,
       - token schema validation,
       - session token persistence.
    - Rewired `packages/core/src/routers/agentRouter.ts` chat mutation to live `llmService` generation with graceful degraded fallback.
    - Replaced `packages/core/src/agents/Researcher.ts` stub output path with model-backed synthesis (`modelSelector` + `generateText` + JSON extraction).
    - Reduced MetaMCP proxy stub dependency in `packages/core/src/services/metamcp-proxy.service.ts` by wiring:
       - real `CodeExecutorService`,
       - real saved-script repository adapter,
       - repository-backed tool search,
       - repository-backed tool sync/upsert,
       - LLM-backed `run_agent` adapter (replacing stubbed agent service path),
       - removed dead run_python stub branch.

8. **Jules access path wired into Borg Web:**
    - Added `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/jules/page.tsx` so Jules Autopilot is reachable from Borg dashboard.
    - Added `apps/web/src/app/api/jules/route.ts` as in-app Jules API proxy (`GET`/`POST`/`DELETE`).
    - Added dashboard home navigation card entry for Jules (`/dashboard/jules`).
   - Enhanced `/dashboard/jules` with in-page API key controls and live connectivity testing against `/api/jules` to reduce setup friction.
   - Added persisted session-sync telemetry + "Last Sync Results" panel so operators can inspect recent cloud update success/fallback/error outcomes.
    - Operational note: this delivers immediate access + embedding path; deeper session lifecycle parity still tracks `updateSession` implementation in `packages/ui/src/lib/jules/client.ts`.

9. **AI tools parity + namespace coverage closure (baseline):**
    - Added route: `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/mcp/ai-tools/page.tsx`.
    - Wired live dashboard inventory to:
       - `trpc.tools.list`
       - `trpc.mcpServers.list`
       - `trpc.apiKeys.list`
    - Added explicit baseline UI coverage for previously unrepresented namespaces:
       - `trpc.expert.getStatus`
       - `trpc.session.getState`
       - `trpc.agentMemory.stats`
       - `trpc.serverHealth.check`
       - `trpc.shell.getSystemHistory`
    - Navigation wired in:
       - `apps/web/src/components/mcp/nav-config.ts`
       - `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/mcp/page.tsx` panel order + metadata.

       - `packages/core/src/scripts/verify_research_recursion.ts`
       - `packages/core/src/tests/Phase28_SmartContext.test.ts`
       - `packages/core/src/db/index.ts`
       - `packages/core/src/db/metamcp-schema.ts`
    - Replaced SQLite boolean defaults with strict typed boolean literals in schema definitions (`true`/`false` instead of `1`/`0`).
    - Added explicit recursive result typing in research verification script to preserve behavior without suppression directives.
    - Validation:
       - `rg -n "@ts-(ignore|nocheck)" packages/core/src` returns no matches.
       - `pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit` passes (`CORE_TSC_OK`).

26. **Technical-debt batch XVII (TODO closure + runtime resilience):**
    - Implemented in-memory LRU eviction for workflow state cache in `packages/core/src/orchestrator/WorkflowEngine.ts`:
       - Added `maxLoadedEntries` bound,
       - Added recency tracking (`markRecentlyUsed`),
       - Added bounded eviction (`enforceMemoryLimit`) to prevent unbounded in-memory growth while preserving persisted state behavior.
    - Closed auth-context TODO in `packages/core/src/routers/mcpServersRouter.ts`:
       - Added safe context extraction helper for `session.user.id`,
       - `list` now passes optional `userId` to `mcpServersRepository.findAll(userId)` when available.
    - Validation:
       - `pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit` passes (`CORE_TSC_OK`).
       - Targeted TODO scan for edited files returns no matches.

27. **Technical-debt batch XVIII (repository TODO cleanup):**
    - Updated `packages/core/src/db/repositories/tools.repo.ts` to replace stale Phase-3 TODO stubs with an explicit feature-flagged post-upsert hook:
       - Added `runPostUpsertHooks(results)` extension point,
       - Hook is disabled by default unless `ENABLE_TOOL_AI_POST_PROCESSING=true`, preserving current runtime behavior.
    - Removed outdated TODO comment markers in the file while retaining future integration intent in concrete code.
    - Validation:
       - `pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit` passes (`CORE_TSC_OK`).
       - Targeted TODO scan for `tools.repo.ts` returns no matches.

28. **Technical-debt batch XIX (web typing hardening + TRPC route decoupling):**
    - Tightened endpoint editor typing in `apps/web/src/components/mcp/EditEndpoint.tsx`:
       - Replaced loose `any` usage with explicit local types (`EndpointLike`, `NamespaceOption`, `EndpointMutationPayload`).
       - Removed `as any` mutation casts while preserving existing UX behavior.
    - Updated Next web config in `apps/web/next.config.ts` to reduce native-module bundling pressure:
       - narrowed `transpilePackages` to `@borg/ui`,
       - documented additional server external package candidates for native stacks.
    - Reworked `apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` from direct in-process `@borg/core` router import to upstream TRPC proxy mode:
       - avoids bundling core/memory native dependencies in web API route,
       - adds explicit upstream resolution (`BORG_TRPC_UPSTREAM`) with safe fallback and 502 error payload on upstream failure.
    - Validation:
       - File diagnostics clean for modified web files.
       - `pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit` passes (`CORE_TSC_OK`).
       - Webpack build was repeatedly invoked; full terminal completion line was not reliably emitted in task output stream, so final web build pass/fail could not be asserted with absolute certainty in this session.

## Current state snapshot

- **Build/typing posture:** `apps/web` was recently validated clean, but repository layer and several UI surfaces still retain concentrated `@ts-ignore` debt requiring a dedicated hardening pass.
- **Backend realism posture:** major P0 stubs for saved scripts, OAuth exchange, agent chat, Researcher, and MetaMCP execution/agent pathways have been replaced; primary residual risk is now repository/UI type debt and OAuth hardening polish.
- **Dashboard parity posture:** networking resilience and endpoint centralization are improved; AI tools route + namespace baseline coverage are now present, with remaining work focused on deeper provider billing/usage/OAuth and advanced control workflows.

## Deep reality audit (extreme-detail pass) — evidence summary

This audit was completed via canonical doc reconciliation + source scans + router coverage analysis. The following findings should be treated as authoritative until closed:

1. **Stub/simulated critical backend behavior still present**
   - No known P0 runtime execution stub remains in the previously flagged backend paths.
   - Residual naming-only helper: `toon.serializer.stub` (non-blocking utility naming debt).

2. **Frontend parity gaps remain despite runtime stabilization**
   - `/dashboard/mcp/ai-tools` now exists with live baseline inventory + namespace coverage.
   - Remaining gap is advanced provider status/auth/install/usage/billing matrix depth.
   - `/dashboard/jules` is present in `apps/web`, but advanced cloud-session parity behavior remains incomplete.
   - Tools dashboard implementation in `packages/ui/src/app/dashboard/tools/page.tsx` still enriches runtime state with mock/fallback data.

3. **Router-to-UI namespace coverage baseline now landed**
   - `/dashboard/mcp/ai-tools` includes direct usage for: `agentMemory`, `expert`, `serverHealth`, `session`, `shell`.
   - Follow-up required: deepen from observability widgets into richer control workflows.

4. **Type debt hotspots**
   - Dense `@ts-ignore` usage remains in `packages/core/src/db/repositories/*` and select user-facing components.

5. **Additional concrete TODO hotspots**
   - `packages/core/src/db/repositories/tools.repo.ts` (Phase 3 TODO)
   - `packages/ui/src/lib/jules/client.ts` (baseline `updateSession` is implemented; advanced parity/error semantics still need hardening)
   - `packages/ui/src/components/kanban-board.tsx` (sync exists; reliability hardening still pending)
   - `apps/web/src/components/DirectorConfig.tsx` (endpoint test TODO)
   - `apps/web/src/components/mcp/EditEndpoint.tsx` (namespace placeholder TODO)
   - `apps/web/src/app/api/prompts/route.ts` (regex extraction TODO)
   - `packages/browser-extension/background.js` (fuzzy click TODO)

---

## Highest-priority next actions

1. Finish remaining MetaMCP `run_agent` de-stubbing and add focused tests for newly-wired P0 backend paths.
2. Expand `/dashboard/mcp/ai-tools` from baseline inventory into full provider billing/usage/OAuth and action workflows.
3. Deepen namespace coverage (`agentMemory`, `expert`, `serverHealth`, `session`, `shell`) from status visibility into operational controls.
4. Execute type-hardening sprint on repositories and remaining UI ignore waivers.
5. Re-run release gates (typecheck/build/placeholder scan) and only then advance version/changelog.

---

## Canonical docs (read in this order)

1. `ROADMAP.md`
2. `STATUS.md`
3. `TODO.md`
4. `docs/DETAILED_BACKLOG.md`
5. `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Release integrity rule

Before tagging any new release:

- `VERSION.md` must match changelog release heading.
- `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, and `HANDOFF.md` must not reference an older canonical version.
- Any major status claim in docs must be tied to either a validated run or explicit TODO.

## Antigravity Session — 2026-02-17 (Documentation & Hardening)

### What was completed
1.  **Documentation Consolidation**:
    -   Verified `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc. reference `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
    -   Created [`docs/MEMORY.md`](docs/MEMORY.md) detailing the Tiered Memory System.
    -   Created [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) with installation and build instructions.
    -   Synchronized `VERSION` file to **2.6.3** to match `VERSION.md`.

2.  **Codebase Hardening**:
    -   **Repository Layer**: Verified `packages/core/src/db/repositories/*.ts` are free of `@ts-ignore` directives.
    -   **Frontend**: Fixed build-blocking type error in `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/skills/page.tsx` (removed explicit `any`-like typing).
    -   **Frontend**: Verified `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/council/page.tsx` is free of `@ts-ignore`.

3.  **Verification**:
    -   `pnpm -F @borg/core build` (tsc) **PASSED** (Exit code 0).
    -   `pnpm run check:placeholders` **PASSED** (Exit code 0).
    -   `pnpm -F @borg/web build` **IN PROGRESS** (reached optimization phase).

### Next Steps
1.  Monitor completion of `apps/web` build.
2.  Commit and push changes.
3.  Continue with Phase 64 release candidates.
