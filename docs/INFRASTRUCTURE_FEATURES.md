## Code Indexing Features (Serena)

### Semantic Code Understanding
- [ ] Symbol-level code understanding via LSP
- [ ] Find symbols across project
- [ ] Reference lookup (find all usages)
- [ ] Insert code after specific symbol
- [ ] Relational structure exploitation

### Architecture
- [ ] MCP server integration
- [ ] LSP (Language Server Protocol) backend
- [ ] `multilspy` library for language servers
- [ ] Model-agnostic LLM integration

### Code Operations
- [ ] Semantic code retrieval
- [ ] Precise code editing at symbol level
- [ ] Large file incremental editing
- [ ] Syntax checking with feedback
- [ ] Complex refactoring (rename + update refs)

### Indexing
- [ ] Full codebase indexing
- [ ] Cross-reference database building
- [ ] Architectural pattern identification
- [ ] Project-specific context storage

### Language Support
- [ ] Python, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript
- [ ] PHP, Go, Rust, C/C++
- [ ] Indirect: Ruby, C#

### Memory Features
- [ ] Persistent "memories" storage
- [ ] Requirements tracking
- [ ] Design decisions
- [ ] Debug findings
- [ ] Cross-session persistence
- [ ] Team sharing

## Code Sandbox Features (E2B)

### Core Sandbox
- [ ] Isolated ephemeral VMs
- [ ] Firecracker microVMs (hardware isolation)
- [ ] <200ms spin-up time

- [ ] Streaming support (stdout, stderr, charts)
- [ ] Reconnect to running sandboxes

### File Management
- [ ] File upload to sandbox
- [ ] Result download
- [ ] Terminal command execution

## Implementation Priority for Borg

### Phase 1: Code Indexing
1. Integrate LSP for semantic understanding
2. Build symbol index and cross-references
3. Implement symbol-based editing

### Phase 2: Sandboxing
1. E2B integration for code execution
2. Isolated environment for agent actions
3. Multi-language support

### Phase 3: Browser Automation
1. Puppeteer MCP server
2. Screenshot and DOM extraction
3. Form automation for testing
