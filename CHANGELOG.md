## Borg Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.7.126] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search-ui): added telemetry source filtering (`all`, `runtime-search`, `cached-ranking`, `live-aggregator`) in `/dashboard/mcp/search` so operators can isolate source-specific behavior without leaving the panel.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): added a status-over-time trend strip that shows per-bucket success/error ratio for the selected telemetry scope, improving quick detection of error-heavy windows.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): per-source rows now include a one-click `Focus failures` action that sets source + error filters together for faster failure triage.

## [2.7.125] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search-ui): added per-source time-bucket trend strips in `/dashboard/mcp/search` so operators can quickly spot momentum shifts in `runtime-search`, `cached-ranking`, and `live-aggregator` traffic.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): trend buckets inherit the active telemetry window preset and display event + error intensity per bucket, improving fast diagnosis of bursty failures versus steady-state traffic.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): per-source telemetry rows now combine volume bar, success/error counts, average latency, and short bucketed trend context in a single triage panel.

## [2.7.124] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search-ui): added telemetry time-window presets (`all`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `24h`) in `/dashboard/mcp/search` so operators can triage routing events by recent incident window instead of scanning a single rolling list.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): telemetry summary chips now reflect the active filter window/type/status scope, making `total/success/error` counts match the currently visible slice.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): added a per-source telemetry breakdown panel (runtime-search, cached-ranking, live-aggregator) with event-volume bars plus success/error and average-latency context to speed up source-level ranking diagnostics.

## [2.7.123] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search-ui): added telemetry summary chips (`total`, `success`, `errors`) to `/dashboard/mcp/search` for at-a-glance event health.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): added in-panel telemetry filters by event type (`search`, `load`, `hydrate`, `unload`) and status (`success`, `error`) so operators can isolate decision and failure events faster.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): telemetry list now applies the selected filters before rendering the latest entries, reducing noise during routing diagnostics.

## [2.7.122] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search): cached-ranking telemetry now records auto-load execution state (`success`, `error`, `not-attempted`) so decision telemetry distinguishes selection from runtime load execution.
- changed(mcp/search): auto-load `load_tool` failures are now captured as explicit `load` telemetry events with error status/message instead of being silently swallowed.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): `/dashboard/mcp/search` telemetry cards now show auto-load execution status and any load failure message for faster operator triage of ranking-vs-runtime issues.

## [2.7.121] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search): enriched search telemetry with second-candidate context (`secondResultName`, `secondMatchReason`, `secondScore`) and explicit score-gap capture across runtime-search, cached-ranking, and live-aggregator paths.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): `/dashboard/mcp/search` telemetry cards now render top-vs-second candidate details so operators can diagnose ambiguity and near-tie ranking behavior without leaving the page.
- changed(mcp/decision-observability): live-aggregator telemetry now records top score and score gap consistently with cached/runtime paths, improving apples-to-apples routing diagnostics.

## [2.7.120] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/working-set): added new `clear_eviction_history` meta-tool so operators can reset recent working-set eviction events without restarting the session.
- changed(mcp/router): added `mcp.clearWorkingSetEvictionHistory` mutation that calls the new meta-tool and returns a user-facing clear confirmation message.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): added a `Clear` action in the `/dashboard/mcp/search` **Recent evictions** panel to clear eviction history in-place and refresh the panel immediately.
- test(core): updated `compatibility-tool-definitions.test.ts` expected tool-loading order to include `clear_eviction_history`.

## [2.7.119] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search): added explicit auto-load evaluation outcomes (`loaded`, `skipped`, `not-applicable`) so search telemetry now records whether an auto-load decision was actually evaluated and what happened.
- changed(mcp/search): cached-ranking telemetry now captures auto-load skip rationale (for example, confidence floor not met or ambiguous match), plus the configured minimum confidence used during evaluation.
- changed(mcp/search-ui): `/dashboard/mcp/search` telemetry cards now render auto-load outcome, confidence floor, and skip reasons for clearer operator diagnosis of “why this did/didn’t auto-load”.
- test(core): expanded `toolSearchRanking.test.ts` with coverage for `evaluateAutoLoadCandidate(...)` not-applicable/skipped outcomes while preserving existing auto-load decision behavior.

## [2.7.118] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/working-set): added operator-configurable working-set capacity controls — `maxLoadedTools` (4..64, default 16) and `maxHydratedSchemas` (2..32, default 8) are now persisted in `mcp.jsonc` preferences.
- changed(mcp/working-set): `SessionToolWorkingSet` gained a `reconfigure()` method so capacity changes take effect on the live session immediately after saving preferences, without a restart.
- changed(mcp/working-set): added a bounded eviction-history ring buffer (last 20 events) with `getEvictionHistory()` / `clearEvictionHistory()` — each entry records the evicted tool name, timestamp, and tier (`loaded` | `hydrated`).
- changed(mcp/meta-tools): added two new meta-tools — `set_capacity` (reconfigures the working-set limits at runtime) and `get_eviction_history` (returns the bounded recent eviction log). Registered in `toolLoadingDefinitions.ts` and handled in `metamcp-proxy.service.ts`.
- changed(mcp/search): `/dashboard/mcp/search` now includes a "Working-set capacity" panel with sliders for `maxLoadedTools`/`maxHydratedSchemas` that save immediately to preferences and apply to the live session.
- changed(mcp/search): `/dashboard/mcp/search` now shows a "Recent evictions" panel (conditionally visible) listing the last up to 10 evicted tools with their tier and relative timestamp, polling every 8 s.
- test(core): updated `metamcp-session-working-set.service.test.ts` with focused coverage for `reconfigure()`, eviction history recording, and `clearEvictionHistory()`.

## [2.7.117] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search): added persisted `autoLoadMinConfidence` tool-selection preference (default `0.85`, bounded `0.50..0.99`) so auto-load behavior is explicitly operator-controlled instead of hardcoded.
- changed(mcp/search): cached-ranking auto-load now respects the configured confidence floor before issuing `load_tool`, reducing unintended eager loads for ambiguous results.
- changed(mcp/search): `/dashboard/mcp/search` now includes an auto-load confidence threshold control (slider + numeric input) and saves it with the existing important/keep-warm tool preferences.
- changed(mcp/inspector): inspector always-on toggles now preserve the current auto-load confidence preference when updating tool-selection settings.
- test(core): updated tool-preference and JSON-config provider tests for the new confidence field and stabilized the provider test import path to use source modules.

## [2.7.116] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search): added task-profile-aware search ranking (`web-research`, `repo-coding`, `browser-automation`, `local-ops`, `database`) so tool discovery can bias toward the current workflow instead of generic scoring alone.
- changed(mcp/search): `/dashboard/mcp/search` now includes a task profile selector that threads profile context into search requests and surfaces the active profile in search guidance and telemetry entries.
- changed(mcp/search): search telemetry now records the selected profile across runtime, cached, and live-aggregator search paths for clearer explainability of ranking behavior.

## [2.7.115] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search): expanded decision telemetry to include search/load/hydrate/unload latency, top score, score gap, auto-load reason, and auto-load confidence so routing behavior is operator-explainable.
- changed(mcp/search): telemetry panel now renders score-gap/confidence/latency fields, making it easier to diagnose ambiguity vs latency as the root cause of poor tool selection outcomes.

## [2.7.114] — 2026-03-14

- changed(policies): `/dashboard/mcp/policies` now shows an explicit audit/preview-mode banner clarifying that policy rules are editable but runtime allow/deny enforcement is currently pass-through in this build.
- docs(core): `policy.service.stub.ts` now includes explicit compatibility comments documenting its non-enforcing placeholder behavior to reduce accidental assumptions in future UI/runtime work.

## [2.7.113] — 2026-03-14

- changed(mcp/search): added direct `Hydrate schema` actions on both search-result cards and loaded working-set cards, so operators can hydrate metadata-only tools without leaving `/dashboard/mcp/search`.
- changed(mcp/search): split loaded tool display into explicit `Server always-on`, `Keep warm profile`, and `Dynamic loaded` sections for clearer operator understanding of why tools are resident.
- changed(mcp/search): distinguished badges for server-advertised always-on tools vs user keep-warm preferences, avoiding the prior conflation of both under a single "always on" label.
- changed(mcp/search): load/unload/hydrate actions now invalidate working-set, search, and tool-selection telemetry queries together for immediate UI state consistency.

## [2.7.112] — 2026-03-14

- feat(dashboard): added `/dashboard/tests` — Auto-Test Runner page backed by `tests` tRPC procedures (`status`, `start`, `stop`, `results`) with watcher controls and per-file output inspection.
- feat(session): added `/dashboard/session/[id]` — session detail page with metadata, attach-info panel, health snapshot, live log tail, and contextual shell execution via `session.executeShell`.
- changed(session): added `View Details` action button on `/dashboard/session` cards linking directly to the new dynamic session detail route.
- changed(nav): added `Tests` entry to Labs navigation so the test-runner surface is reachable from sidebar navigation.

## [2.7.111] — 2026-03-14

- feat(dashboard): added `/dashboard/command` — Command Center page with live slash-command list, REPL execution via `commands` tRPC namespace, and arrow-key history navigation.
- feat(dashboard): added `/dashboard/chronicle` — Git Chronicle page with configurable commit log and working-tree status via `git` tRPC namespace.
- feat(dashboard): added `/dashboard/library` — Resource Library hub linking to scripts, skills, tool sets, memory, plans, manual, chronicle, and architecture with live item counts from `savedScripts` and `skills` tRPC namespaces.
- feat(dashboard): added `/dashboard/context` — Context Manager page for add/remove/clear of context files and assembled context prompt viewer via `borgContext` tRPC namespace.
- changed(nav): added "Sessions" link to `CORE_DASHBOARD_NAV` pointing to `/dashboard/session` so the session supervisor is reachable from the main nav section.
- changed(nav): added "Context Manager" entry to `LABS_DASHBOARD_NAV` pointing to `/dashboard/context`.
- changed(nav): added inline descriptions for `Command`, `Symbols`, `Code`, `Chronicle`, and `Library` nav items.
- changed(nav): imported `MonitorPlay` and `FolderOpen` icons for new Session and Context nav entries.
- task(tracking): seeded `tasks/backlog/` with three new implementation-ready task briefs: stub-debt reduction, MCP working-set hydration UX, and session detail/worktree reliability.

## [Unreleased]

- changed(health): `/dashboard/health` now treats degraded `startupStatus` compat-fallback snapshots as a first-class state in the top-level MCP Router metric, showing degraded router telemetry instead of implying the router is merely still initializing.

- changed(health): `/dashboard/health` now treats degraded `startupStatus` compat-fallback snapshots as a first-class state in the top-level Event Bus metric, showing degraded telemetry instead of implying the service is merely still starting.

- changed(integrations): `/dashboard/integrations` now treats degraded `startupStatus` compat-fallback snapshots as unavailable live bridge telemetry, showing the live fallback summary instead of claiming the extension bridge is still simply booting.

- changed(memory): `/dashboard/memory/claude-mem` now treats degraded `startupStatus` compat-fallback snapshots as a first-class operator state, surfacing the live fallback summary instead of collapsing that payload into generic "Core warming up" copy.

- changed(dashboard): startup surfaces now recognize the local compat-fallback startup contract, showing degraded startup status and the live fallback summary on `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/health`, and `/dashboard/mcp/system` instead of collapsing that state into generic warmup copy.

- changed(dashboard): `/dashboard/health` and `/dashboard/mcp/system` now read `NODE_ENV`, platform, uptime, and version from the live `startupStatus` runtime metadata instead of hardcoded placeholders, and the shared uptime formatter now treats core uptime as seconds rather than milliseconds.

- changed(dashboard): retired the remaining startup "phases" wording on the health, system, and home dashboard surfaces so operator copy now consistently reflects the current startup-check contract.

- changed(billing): added curated quick-access sections to `/dashboard/billing` so operators can jump straight to API keys/tokens, plans/billing/credits, and cloud/OAuth consoles before drilling into the full provider portal matrix.

- changed(dashboard): improved the `/dashboard` first-run zero-provider experience so the overview metric, provider panel, and fallback panel now tell operators to configure their first provider instead of showing passive empty-state copy.

- docs(readme): aligned `README.md` with the current local `pnpm run dev` readiness launcher, clarified that Docker still exposes the dashboard on `localhost:3001`, documented dynamic dashboard port fallback for local dev, and pointed the repo layout at `apps/borg-extension` as the official browser-extension workspace.

- docs(deploy): aligned `DEPLOY.md` with the verified `0.9.0-beta` control-plane workflow, including the root `pnpm run dev` readiness launcher, dashboard port fallback behavior, core bridge probes on `3001`, and startup troubleshooting for dynamic dashboard ports.

- fix(startup): gate verbose `packages/core/src/MCPServer.ts` import/boot progress logs behind `BORG_MCP_SERVER_DEBUG=1` or `DEBUG=borg:mcp-server`, keeping normal `pnpm run dev` output quiet while preserving real errors and fallback warnings.

- fix(startup): `pnpm run dev` now best-effort replaces a reused Borg core bridge that is healthy but serving an older `startupStatus` contract by stopping the stale owner via the Borg startup lock when available, or via the current port-3001 listener PID only when that listener's command line still looks Borg-owned, before launching a fresh CLI/core instance.

- fix(startup): `pnpm run dev` now requires the live `startupStatus` payload to expose the current readiness-contract fields before declaring the stack ready, so reusing an older core bridge no longer produces a false green boot summary and instead surfaces a specific startup-contract refresh warning.

- test(validation): re-ran the current startup, memory, MCP probe, and billing fallback slices directly after noisy task-terminal output, confirming the live workspace is green (`33` focused core tests, `43` focused web tests, focused fallback rerun, `CORE_TSC_OK`, and `WEB_TSC_OK`) without additional code fixes.

- test(validation): stabilized the focused dashboard fallback integration mock so `DashboardHomeClient` can be rendered under Vitest without leaking into the real tRPC hook context, then re-verified the startup, memory, MCP probe, and dashboard slices with focused core/web tests plus a clean `apps/web` typecheck.

- docs(cleanup): removed the duplicated stale root README content, aligned the documented web landing route with the real `/ -> /dashboard` redirect, added an explicit `docs/archive/README.md` marker for archive-only material, restored the task-file flow by moving completed slices out of `tasks/active/`, and pruned unused service stubs from `packages/core/src/services/stubs/`.

- fixed(dashboard): the MCP system status page now reuses the shared startup readiness helpers for cached-vs-live/runtime cards, so on-demand-only router postures no longer show false resident-runtime warnings while cached inventory is already operational.
- fixed(startup): startup readiness now derives advertised cached server/tool counts and always-on posture from the same selected inventory source (`database`, `config`, or `empty`), so last-known-good config snapshots no longer report stale DB-backed MCP counts during non-blocking warmup.
- changed(memory): refined backend cross-session memory links so sessions with similarly worded goals/objectives can correlate even when the intent anchor text is not an exact string match, improving related-record recall for `/dashboard/memory`.
- changed(memory): extended backend `/dashboard/memory` pivots to understand prompt/session-summary goal and objective anchors, so inspector pivot chips can now re-query related intent-driven records instead of only session/tool/concept/file links.
- changed(memory): grouped the `/dashboard/memory` session window around the selected anchor into explicit `Earlier in session` and `Later in session` sections, making same-session chronology clearer without changing the underlying backend timeline query.
- changed(memory): added a backend `getCrossSessionMemoryLinks` path and a new `/dashboard/memory` inspector card for related records from other sessions, so selected observations can surface recurring concepts, files, tools, and sources across session boundaries instead of only within the active session timeline.
- changed(memory): refined cross-session memory correlation so prompt and session-summary goals/objectives propagate at the session level, allowing selected observations to surface related work from other sessions even when the observation itself does not store explicit goal metadata.
- changed(memory): added a backend `getMemoryTimelineWindow` path plus a pure session-window helper so `/dashboard/memory` can show nearby same-session records around the selected memory anchor instead of relying only on generic related-record heuristics.
- changed(memory): added a backend `searchMemoryPivot` path and service-level structured pivot matching for session/tool/concept/file metadata, then wired `/dashboard/memory` to use those backend results so inspector pivots return real related records instead of only steering local UI state.
- changed(memory): added one-click inspector search pivots to `/dashboard/memory` so selected records can immediately re-query by session, tool, concept, or file metadata, and made `All Records` aggregate generic facts with observation/prompt/session-summary searches instead of only hitting the generic memory path.
- changed(memory): added related-record pivots to the `/dashboard/memory` inspector so selected observations, prompts, and session summaries can jump to correlated records from the same session, tool, source, concepts, or files without leaving the native Borg memory timeline.
- changed(memory): turned `/dashboard/memory` search results into a structured timeline plus detail inspector, grouping records by day and rendering observation/prompt/session-summary sections so operators can drill into Borg-native memory provenance instead of scanning a flat blob list.
- changed(memory): upgraded `/dashboard/memory` from a generic full-text list into a Borg-native record explorer with explicit search modes for facts, observations, prompts, and session summaries, added a visible memory-model explainer, and extracted tested helper logic for coherent record titles, previews, timestamps, and provenance tokens.
- changed(memory): aligned the primary memory dashboard and claude-mem parity surface around Borg's actual native memory model, including typed observations, captured prompts, session summaries, clearer provenance, and corrected tier/stat reporting instead of framing claude-mem as the whole runtime story.
- docs(tasking): completed the ecosystem assimilation consolidation brief, promoted the memory-story follow-up into `tasks/active/`, and anchored the Borg-native Track A-F capability map in the roadmap, TODO, and handoff docs so future work references scoped Borg tracks instead of repo-wide parity demands.
- fixed(startup): aligned the Tabby dev launcher waiting logic with resident/always-on MCP runtime semantics, so Borg no longer reports startup complete before resident servers warm or waits on the wrong live-runtime label.
- changed(startup): Borg's stdio MCP entrypoint now best-effort boots the long-running Borg core as a detached background process when an MCP client launches the router before the control plane is already up, so the interactive MCP client can proceed while the dashboard/bridge warm in parallel.
- changed(mcp): always-on downstream MCP servers now warm in the background from cached advertised inventory, keeping startup non-blocking while exposing live runtime state, warmup posture, and latest runtime errors more truthfully in the MCP dashboard and inspection panel.
- fixed(startup): `startupStatus` now counts only actually connected downstream MCP servers as live, while separately surfacing warming and failed warmup counts so the dashboard no longer overstates live runtime readiness during non-blocking startup.
- changed(startup): split Borg startup readiness into cached MCP inventory vs live MCP runtime semantics, including advertised cached server/tool counts and always-on tool counts so operators can see what is available immediately while live connections continue warming.
- changed(dashboard): updated the home dashboard, MCP system status helpers, and launcher waiting labels to explain cached-vs-live MCP posture, memory/context readiness, and non-blocking warmup behavior more truthfully.
- test(startup): added focused regression coverage for always-on cached tool advertisement, cached-vs-live startup checklist copy, system status rows, and launcher wait-label semantics.
- fix(mcp): `discoverServerTools` now supports SSE and STREAMABLE_HTTP transports alongside STDIO, with a 30-second timeout to prevent hanging discoveries.
- fix(config): `mcp.json` and `mcp.jsonc` now default to `~/.borg/` instead of the workspace root via new `getBorgConfigDir()` helper; `JsonConfigProvider` updated to match.
## [0.9.0-beta] - 2026-03-11

### ✨ Features & Parity Updates
- **Health, Logs & Operator Surfaces**: Exposed real-time tRPC-driven dashboards under the "Borg 1.0 Core" section.
  - `Health Dashboard`: Tracks system startup readiness, event bus/DB status, and instance-level MCP server crash counts/error states.
  - `Logs Dashboard`: Live searchable view of tool executions, error rates, average latency, and top requested tools.
  - `System Audit Dashboard`: Centralized timeline of security, configuration, and agent-driven events.
- **Dashboard Honesty Pass**: Restructured application navigation (Top Nav & Sidebar) to clearly separate "Borg 1.0 Core" features from "Labs & Experimental" pages.
- **Experimental Guardrails**: Added explicit "Labs" and "Beta" UI badges to developmental surfaces including the Director, Council, and Super Assistant dashboards.

### 🐛 Fixes & Polish
- **Session Supervisor Operator Loop**: Added clear UI badges for "Manual Restart" and "Crashed" session states, surfaced underlying crash errors on session cards, enforced reliable worktree isolation when configured, and improved cross-platform terminal attach commands.
- **System Status Truthfulness**: The System Status page now renders live tRPC data for Database (SQLite), Event Bus, Version (v0.9.0-beta), and real-time Uptime, removing previously hardcoded placeholders.
- **MCP Discovery Timeout**: Added a 30-second timeout to MCP server discovery handshakes to prevent infinite hanging when an upstream server stalls.
- docs: replaced the root `ROADMAP.md` milestone stub with a reality-based roadmap that reflects the current shipped, partial, and blocked Borg surfaces.
- docs: added canonical root `TODO.md` and `HANDOFF.md` files so implementor models have an ordered queue and current handoff instead of relying on archived docs.
- fix(cli): `borg start` now writes a single-instance lock in `~/.borg/lock`, refuses duplicate live startups, clears stale locks automatically, and reuses the stale lock's old port when that port is still available.
- changed(mcp): removed the active namespaces/endpoints tRPC surface from Borg's current control plane so MCP discovery now leans on semantic search/grouping instead of operator-managed namespace or multi-endpoint configuration.
- fix(core): resolve the supervisor entry from the monorepo root instead of the caller cwd so `@borg/cli` dev startup no longer looks for `packages/cli/packages/borg-supervisor/dist/index.js`.
- fix(core): defer the MCP bridge HTTP/WebSocket bind to `MCPServer.start()` while preserving `/api/mesh/stream`, so the control plane claims port `3001` in one place during startup.
- test(core): added `packages/core/test/orchestrator.test.ts` to lock the cwd-independent supervisor resolution behavior.

### Added
- Added a Borg-native structured observation ingest path in `AgentMemoryService`, including typed observation records, heuristic fact/concept/file extraction, short-window content-hash deduplication, richer memory stats, and new memory-router procedures for recording plus querying recent/searchable observations.
- Added provider-native memory interchange support for Borg JSON and claude-mem stores, including import/export and format conversion through the memory dashboard and tRPC API.
- Added one-click MCP server operator actions on `/dashboard/mcp`, including a combined `Load + cache` flow plus direct shortcuts into tool inspection, tool-behavior editing, and logs for each downstream server.
- Added default-section coverage reporting to `memory.getClaudeMemStatus` plus state-aware operator guidance on `/dashboard/memory/claude-mem`, so the parity page now distinguishes between a missing adapter store, an empty seeded store, incomplete default bucket coverage, and an actively populated claude-mem shell.
- Added active memory-pipeline reporting to `memory.getClaudeMemStatus`, so `/dashboard/memory/claude-mem` now shows whether claude-mem is actually wired into Borg's current runtime memory fan-out instead of only inferring readiness from the presence of `.borg/claude_mem.json` on disk.
- Added a core-backed install-artifact detector for the Integration Hub so `/dashboard/integrations` now reports whether browser-extension bundles, Firefox-ready assets, VS Code `.vsix` packages, and Borg MCP config sources actually exist on disk instead of only showing static build hints.
- Added a formal extension-bridge client registration contract in `packages/core/src/bridge/bridge-manifest.ts`, including `BORG_CLIENT_HELLO` metadata normalization plus supported non-MCP capability and hook-phase manifests for live bridge clients.
- Added focused bridge-manifest regression coverage in `packages/core/src/bridge/bridge-manifest.test.ts` for default client registration, hello metadata merge behavior, and stable manifest generation.
- Added task-filtered fallback-chain inspection to `billing.getFallbackChain`, plus a selector on `/dashboard/billing` so operators can inspect the ranked provider chain for general, coding, planning, research, worker, and supervisor work instead of only a single generic fallback list.
- Added a core-backed `memory.getClaudeMemStatus` query plus live adapter-store details on `/dashboard/memory/claude-mem`, so the parity page now reports actual `.borg/claude_mem.json` existence, section counts, and last-update state instead of only static audit copy.
- Added a dedicated `/dashboard/memory/claude-mem` parity/status surface that replaces the old vector-dashboard passthrough with an honest view of Borg's current claude-mem assimilation: shipped adapter pieces, partial adjacent memory foundations, and the still-missing upstream hook/search/injection/runtime gaps.
- Added a cross-panel operator alert strip to `/dashboard` that summarizes router disconnects, startup readiness drift, degraded providers, and failed supervised sessions in one place so first-time operators can spot trouble without scanning every panel.
- Added a real supervised-session creation flow on `/dashboard/session`, including detected CLI harness selection, working-directory/env/arg inputs, worktree and auto-restart toggles, and live session controls so operators can launch Borg-managed CLI sessions from the dashboard instead of only from backend procedures.
- Added a session details dialog on `/dashboard/session` with buffered supervisor logs, health status, and copyable attach command details so the session supervisor now exposes operator-facing runtime context instead of only compact card summaries.
- Added a task-routing matrix to `/dashboard/billing` plus a new billing router query so operators can see Borg's per-task provider strategy defaults and top-ranked fallback previews for coding, planning, research, worker, supervisor, and general requests.
- Added fleet-level MCP discovery actions on `/dashboard/mcp`, including managed-server summary counts plus one-click retry for unresolved metadata and full binary rediscovery across all managed servers.
- Added editable provider-routing controls on `/dashboard/billing`, including live default strategy updates and per-task routing overrides so operators can tune cost-versus-quality behavior without restarting Borg.
- Added the thirteenth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by preserving stable DOM-backed message identifiers in chat-surface snapshots when surfaces expose them, which reduces operator-facing timeline churn during streaming updates.
- Added the twelfth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by making chat-surface streaming detection adapter-aware for key surfaces like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, so in-progress assistant output survives nested DOM wrappers more reliably.
- Added the eleventh MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by making chat-surface role inference adapter-aware for key surfaces like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, so nested DOM wrappers preserve who said what more reliably.
- Added the tenth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by preserving per-execution streaming state in chat-surface snapshots, so pending or newly matched tool runs stay visibly "live" in the traffic inspector instead of dropping back to static timeline rows.
- Added the ninth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by preserving best-effort message roles and streaming-state hints in chat-surface snapshots, so the traffic inspector can distinguish user, assistant, tool, and in-progress messages instead of showing anonymous text only.
- Added the eighth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by recognizing unfinished streaming markdown fence blocks in chat-surface snapshots, so in-progress tool calls and results show up before the closing fence lands.
- Added the seventh MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by teaching chat-surface snapshots to recognize unfenced plain-text tool calls and function results, then correlate them into the execution timeline alongside XML/JSON/markdown payloads.
- Added the sixth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by correlating chat-surface tool calls and function results into a lightweight execution timeline that survives unmatched pending/result-only observations.
- Added the fifth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by enriching chat-surface snapshots with structured function-result status, summary, and key-field extraction for future render-widget and automation work.
- Added the fourth MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by enriching chat-surface snapshots with extracted tool parameters and function-result candidate detection for future automation and widget rendering work.
- Added the third MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by introducing chat-surface observation telemetry, lightweight tool-call candidate extraction, and traffic-inspector visibility for supported web AI chat surfaces.
- Added the second MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by introducing a host-aware adapter registry plus an injected shadow-DOM sidebar scaffold across the supported browser-chat footprint.
- Added in-page Borg browser actions for supported AI chat surfaces, including adapter-detected input/submit controls, quick page absorption, RAG ingestion, URL copy, and dashboard deep-linking from the new sidebar shell.
- Added the first MCP-SuperAssistant assimilation slice for Borg's browser extension by widening the manifest/content-script browser-chat footprint to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Google AI Studio, Perplexity, Grok, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, T3 Chat, GitHub Copilot, Mistral, Kimi, Qwen Chat, and Z.ai across Chrome/Edge/Firefox.
- Added a richer `apps/extension` popup operator view that now reports the active surface, supported-platform footprint, and live bridge capabilities instead of only showing ingest buttons.
- Added a real `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity/status surface that distinguishes what Borg has already assimilated from MCP-SuperAssistant (generic bridge footprint and browser tooling) versus the still-pending adapter/sidebar/automation slices.
- Added a canonical `startupStatus` tRPC system procedure in `packages/core` that summarizes MCP, memory, browser, session-supervisor, and extension-bridge readiness for boot-time orchestration and dashboard consumers.
- Added boot-state tracking getters for MCP config sync, session restoration, and MCP aggregator initialization so `startupStatus` can report completed startup work instead of only object presence.
- Added a normalized provider-routing layer under `packages/core/src/providers/` with provider auth-state detection, quota snapshots, task-aware routing strategies, and fallback-chain inspection for dashboard consumers.
- Added focused provider-routing regression coverage in `packages/core/providers/__tests__/` for auth normalization, quota tracking, deterministic strategy ordering, and quota/rate-limit failover behavior.
- Added a new supervised CLI session runtime under `packages/core/src/supervisor/` with typed session metadata, crash-aware restart handling, persisted session state, log capture, attach info, and worktree-aware isolation hooks.
- Added focused session-supervisor coverage in `packages/core/supervisor/__tests__/` for spawn, restart, health, persistence, and parallel worktree isolation behavior.
- Added a real `/dashboard` home surface in `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/` that composes live MCP status, recent traffic, supervised session controls, and provider quota/fallback state into the four Borg 1.0 panels.
- Added focused web coverage for the new dashboard home view and summary helpers in `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-home-view.test.tsx`.
- Added dashboard integration coverage under `apps/web/tests/integration/` for MCP router status bridging, provider fallback visibility, and supervised session lifecycle actions.

### Changed
- Clarified `/dashboard/mcp` when Borg is operating in local compat fallback mode by surfacing fleet-level `Local compat` counts plus per-server labels that explain those action links are backed by Borg-managed local config records while live core telemetry is unavailable.
- Made `/dashboard/integrations` operator actions directly copyable with inline clipboard feedback, so build commands, install commands, bundle paths, manifest paths, and internal routes can be used without manual retyping.
- Made `/dashboard/integrations` more actionable by deriving a concrete operator action for each install surface, such as the loadable unpacked folder, Firefox manifest path, VSIX install command, packaging command, or MCP settings route.
- Refined `/dashboard/integrations` artifact reporting again so install cards now identify the detected artifact kind (for example VSIX package vs compiled output vs unpacked browser bundle) and show the exact detected timestamp alongside the relative freshness label.
- Enriched `/dashboard/integrations` install-surface detection and cards with declared package version plus artifact age/freshness metadata, so operators can tell whether a detected extension bundle, VSIX, or config source looks current instead of only knowing that a path exists.
- Tightened `/dashboard/integrations` so browser-extension install cards now point at the current packaged `apps/borg-extension` workspace and include status-aware next-step guidance such as build, package, load, or sync actions instead of only static install prose.
- Refined the `startupStatus` readiness contract so Borg now treats an initialized-but-empty MCP inventory as valid, reports the extension bridge as ready when the listener is accepting connections even before any clients attach, and keeps the dashboard startup checklist aligned with that fresher boot semantics instead of waiting forever on zero-client/zero-server fresh installs.
- Replaced the root `build` entrypoint with a cross-platform `scripts/build_all.mjs` orchestrator that now builds Borg's first-party Turbo workspace graph, refreshes and builds the excluded `apps/borg-extension` workspace for both Chromium and Firefox while preserving separate `dist-chromium` / `dist-firefox` outputs, and skips the JetBrains plugin only when Gradle is unavailable unless `BORG_REQUIRE_JETBRAINS_BUILD=true` is set.
- Extended Borg Core's live extension bridge in `packages/core/src/MCPServer.ts` and `packages/core/src/routers/systemProcedures.ts` so connected browser and VS Code clients now self-identify, advertise non-MCP capabilities and supported hook phases, and surface that richer runtime state through `startupStatus` instead of only reporting a raw websocket client count.
- Updated the browser extension, VS Code extension, and `/dashboard/integrations` operator surface so live bridge clients now register with Borg Core on connect and the Integration Hub shows connected clients, advertised non-MCP capabilities, hook phases, and last-seen metadata.
- Updated the home dashboard session ordering so attention-needed supervised sessions (`error`, `restarting`, and other transitional states) now appear ahead of merely recent healthy sessions, making crash/restart posture easier to spot at a glance.
- Exposed session restart policy in the dashboard and session views, so operators can now see when a supervised CLI session is configured for manual restart only instead of assuming Borg will always auto-recover it after a crash.
- Enriched the supervised session surface so Borg now records queued restart timestamps and last-exit details in `packages/core/src/supervisor/`, then surfaces restart countdowns on `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/session` instead of making operators infer backoff posture from raw logs alone.
- Updated the Jules session activity feed so transcript export actions now live behind the upper-right overflow menu, with PDF print joining the existing Markdown/Text/JSON exports through a print-friendly transcript layout.
- Updated the same activity-feed export flow to use format-specific MIME types for Markdown/TXT/JSON downloads and aligned the transcript menu label from `Text` to `TXT`.
- Updated the Jules activity feed's new below-bubble action row so copy now unwraps real message text from placeholder/wrapped payloads and hides itself for empty or non-copyable entries instead of copying useless sentinel strings.
- Updated the browser chat-surface observer, protocol spec, traffic inspector typing, and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to prefer stable DOM-backed message IDs when available instead of always hashing message text.
- Updated the browser content script and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to reflect that streaming inference now uses adapter-aware DOM selectors before falling back to generic busy/class heuristics.
- Updated the browser content script and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to reflect that role inference now uses adapter-aware DOM selectors before falling back to generic class/attribute heuristics.
- Updated the browser chat-surface observer, protocol spec, traffic inspector, and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to surface execution-level streaming metadata alongside the existing message, tool-call, and function-result hints.
- Updated the browser chat-surface observer, protocol spec, traffic inspector, and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to surface message-role and streaming metadata alongside the existing tool-call/result timeline.
- Updated the browser chat-surface observer, protocol spec, and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to reflect that Borg now understands both complete and still-streaming fenced tool/result hints, not just fully closed blocks.
- Updated the browser chat-surface observer, protocol spec, and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to reflect that Borg now recognizes both fenced and plain-text streamed tool/result hints before the full AST/widget layer lands.
- Updated the dashboard traffic inspector, protocol spec, and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to surface the new chat-surface execution timeline alongside tool-call and function-result summaries.
- Updated the dashboard traffic inspector and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to surface structured function-result telemetry instead of only raw candidate detection.
- Updated the dashboard traffic inspector and `/dashboard/super-assistant` parity copy to surface the richer chat-surface snapshots, including structured tool-call parameters and function-result summaries.
- Updated `/dashboard/super-assistant` so the shipped capability matrix now includes the live chat-surface observer scaffold and keeps the remaining backlog focused on deeper automation/render-widget work.
- Updated the browser-extension popup capability/status copy so it now reports the adapter-scaffold slice honestly, distinguishing live adapter/sidebar state from the still-pending automation and full DOM-parity work.
- Updated `/dashboard/super-assistant` so the parity matrix, shipped capability list, and backlog now reflect the live adapter registry plus injected sidebar scaffold instead of listing those slices as still hypothetical.
- Hardened `scripts/dev_tabby_ready.mjs` so root `pnpm run dev` now treats dashboard-side browser/session routes as first-class readiness signals, warms MCP/memory/browser/session queries after the stack comes up, and auto-opens the dashboard once the Tabby-ready surface is actually available.
- Updated `scripts/dev_tabby_ready.mjs` again to prefer the new core `startupStatus` snapshot as its primary readiness contract, while retaining granular MCP/memory/browser/session fallbacks for partial-startup diagnostics.
- Enriched `packages/core/src/routers/systemProcedures.ts` startup reporting with config-sync completion, persisted MCP inventory counts, aggregator initialization state, and session-restore summaries so launcher and dashboard consumers can distinguish "process exists" from "boot work finished".
- Surfaced the richer `startupStatus` payload on the dashboard home and MCP system pages so operators can see startup readiness, cached router inventory, config-sync completion, session restore progress, and extension-bridge state without reading launcher logs.
- Upgraded `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/billing/page.tsx` into a more actionable operator surface by adding direct provider portal links for API keys, usage, billing, subscriptions, and docs, while exposing richer auth-state details from `packages/core/src/routers/billingRouter.ts`.
- Upgraded `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/mcp/ai-tools/page.tsx` into a practical AI tool directory backed by live CLI harness detection, supervised-session counts, and provider-auth/quota metadata, so operators can quickly see which local harnesses are installed and jump into provider management from the same surface.
- Added a new `/dashboard/integrations` hub that consolidates Borg browser-extension install paths, VS Code packaging hints, supported MCP client sync targets, known config locations for adjacent clients, and live bridge/runtime readiness into one operator-facing setup surface.
- Submodule inventory and cleanup tooling now use `.gitmodules` as the live registry source; `scripts/update_submodules_doc.mjs` rebuilds `docs/SUBMODULES.md` from the current registry, `docs/SUBMODULE_DASHBOARD.md` reflects the actual five approved tracked submodules, and `scripts/prune_orphaned_gitlinks.mjs` can remove legacy orphaned gitlinks from the index without touching the five live entries.
- Direct Borg-native MCP mode now exposes a MetaMCP-compatible `run_code` alias and executes it without requiring operators to manually toggle Code Mode first, shrinking the remaining proxy-only surface in `packages/core/src/MCPServer.ts`.
- Direct Borg-native MCP mode now also exposes a MetaMCP-compatible `run_python` alias backed by Borg's sandbox service, further reducing the remaining MetaMCP-only execution surface.
- Direct Borg-native MCP mode now also exposes a MetaMCP-compatible `run_agent` path backed by Borg's native LLM service and delegated direct-mode tool execution, including recursion guards that keep autonomous agent loops from re-entering `run_agent` or `run_code`.
- Direct Borg-native MCP mode now also exposes a MetaMCP-compatible `save_memory` alias backed by Borg's native agent memory service, trimming another direct-mode dependency on the MetaMCP proxy.
- Direct Borg-native MCP mode now also exposes MetaMCP-compatible `save_script` plus direct-mode `script__*` saved-script tools backed by Borg-managed config storage and sandbox execution.
- Direct Borg-native MCP mode now also exposes MetaMCP-compatible `save_tool_set`, `load_tool_set`, and `toolset_list` behavior backed by Borg-managed config storage plus the native session working set, eliminating another chunk of remaining direct-mode proxy dependence.
- Direct Borg-native MCP mode now also exposes MetaMCP-compatible `import_mcp_config` backed by Borg's existing config import service, which closes out the old proxy meta-tool cluster for direct-mode sessions.
- Borg-native MCP handlers now serve downstream `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, `resources/list`, `resources/read`, and `resources/templates/list` through the shared downstream session pool, so prompt/resource discovery no longer depends on the MetaMCP bridge even when that bridge is still mounted for tool middleware.
- The optional MetaMCP proxy now reuses Borg's shared downstream discovery helper for prompt/resource/template passthrough instead of maintaining a second inline implementation, narrowing the remaining bridge-specific surface to tool list/call middleware behavior.
- `packages/core/src/MCPServer.ts` now mounts the optional MetaMCP proxy with downstream discovery registration disabled, so Borg's native prompt/resource handlers stay canonical while the proxy is reduced further toward tool list/call middleware responsibilities.
- Wired `packages/core/src/MCPServer.ts` to use `CoreModelSelector` and updated `billingRouter` to surface normalized provider quota/auth/fallback data when available.
- Extended `packages/core/src/routers/sessionRouter.ts` with supervisor-backed create/list/start/stop/restart/log/health procedures while preserving the existing lightweight session-state endpoints.
- Changed MCP server persistence so `packages/core` now discovers STDIO tool metadata when servers are created or updated, stores the rich cache in Borg-owned `mcp.jsonc`, mirrors discovered tools into the existing DB cache, and keeps a stripped `mcp.json` compatibility export for clients that only understand standard MCP config.
- Archived the legacy phase-based roadmap to `docs/archive/ROADMAP_LEGACY.md` and replaced `ROADMAP.md` with the Borg 1.0/1.5/2.0 milestone plan.
- Seeded the task-file workflow under `tasks/` with initial clean-install, MCP router, provider fallback, session supervisor, and dashboard task briefs.
- Rewrote `README.md` around the focused Borg control-plane scope and updated the quick-start guidance to match the current install/start path.
- Rewrote `VISION.md` to describe the long-term Borg direction in orchestration-first terms instead of the old assimilation/parity framing.
- Added `docs/research/MCP_ROUTER_REFERENCE_EVALUATION_2026-03-07.md`, comparing external MCP router candidates against Borg 1.0 requirements and documenting the recommendation to use upstreams as references rather than adopting a foreign router as Borg's base.
- Tightened the MCP disclosure design guidance in `docs/research/MCP_ROUTER_REFERENCE_EVALUATION_2026-03-07.md` and `docs/guides/PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE.md` to define a tiny always-visible meta-tool set, deferred binary startup, and tool-count-based loading/unloading thresholds.
- Expanded the MCP router research memo with the second lazy-loading/code-mode repo set, a concrete analysis of why aggregators fail in practice, and a Borg-specific hybrid blueprint covering ranked discovery, silent high-confidence loads, deferred binary startup, profiles, code mode, and operator-visible routing decisions.
- Tightened the MetaMCP session working-set runtime to use smaller progressive-disclosure caps, added explicit `unload_tool` / `list_loaded_tools` meta-tools, and added focused unit coverage for loaded-tool and hydrated-schema eviction behavior.
- Refreshed the MCP dashboard search and inspector pages to reflect the new progressive-disclosure flow with visible working-set state, quick load/unload/schema actions, and a more inspector-style multi-pane operator layout inspired by the reviewed example projects.
- Rebuilt `/dashboard/mcp` around Borg's router/aggregator control-plane story, added `/dashboard/mcp/testing` for exploratory MCP surfaces, and updated the MCP navigation so testing workflows no longer crowd the main control-plane landing page.
- Tightened remaining MCP UI copy so Borg's router/control-plane stays primary while the upstream MetaMCP integration is described explicitly as a bridge detail in the sidebar palette, testing lab, and bridge-management page.
- Tightened MCP bridge naming further so navigation and bridge-management UI present Borg as the primary server-bridge surface while still identifying MetaMCP as the upstream implementation detail.
- Refreshed `docs/guides/PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE.md` to match the current search/load/schema/unload working-set model and aligned the remaining MCP landing-page and agent-playground labels with the Borg-first server-bridge terminology.
- Finished the remaining MCP copy cleanup by renaming the standalone bridge embed page to Borg-first bridge terminology and tightening the agent-playground description around the router session working set.
- Renamed the sidebar command-palette MCP action to match the Borg router naming and refreshed the live MCP API/bridge docs so Borg stays primary while MetaMCP is documented as the upstream bridge layer.
- Started the runtime MetaMCP extraction by adding a real `MCP_DISABLE_METAMCP` source-level path in `packages/core/src/MCPServer.ts`, wiring Borg-native direct MCP handlers when the proxy is disabled, and adding focused tests for the new mode-selection helpers.
- Added a Borg-native session working-set manager and direct-handler meta tools (`search_tools`, `load_tool`, `get_tool_schema`, `unload_tool`, `list_loaded_tools`) so the MetaMCP-disabled runtime keeps progressive disclosure behavior without relying on the old proxy layer.
- Removed the redundant constructor-time `MetaMCPController` initialization in `MCPServer`, so the remaining MetaMCP attachment happens only once through the real `setupHandlers()` path with the actual native tool list.
- Reduced proxy dependence further by routing namespaced downstream tools through Borg's native `MCPAggregator` before the MetaMCP proxy, keeping the bridge focused on non-namespaced proxy-only behavior.
- Expanded Borg-first downstream routing so plain tool names that already belong to the aggregated MCP inventory also prefer `MCPAggregator` execution before falling back to the MetaMCP proxy path.
- Removed the hard `MetaMCPController` import from `MCPServer`, lazy-loaded the bridge only when needed, and made startup fall back to Borg-native direct handlers if MetaMCP bootstrap fails.
- Removed the hard `executeProxiedTool` import from `MCPServer`, lazy-loaded the MetaMCP proxy executor only when proxy execution is still required, and kept Borg-native aggregator/router fallback behavior when the proxy module is unavailable.
- Removed the remaining `MetaMCPController` shim indirection by lazy-loading `attachTo(...)` directly from `MCPServer`, leaving the MetaMCP bridge as an optional attach step instead of a dedicated singleton controller service.
- Linked the MCP search and inspector pages more tightly by deep-linking individual tool results into the inspector and auto-selecting the requested tool inside the inspector workspace.
- Kept the MCP inspector URL synchronized with the current tool selection so manual focus changes preserve context across refreshes, shared links, and browser navigation.
- Added direct inspector links to the MCP search page working-set sidebar so already-loaded tools can jump straight into the inspector without a second search.
- Hardened the MCP inspector’s URL sync so browser back/forward and cleared query params no longer leave stale tool state selected, and added a one-click copy-link action for the current tool.
- Reorganized `packages/core/src/mcp` around explicit aggregator types, config storage, namespace helpers, and traffic-inspector support so the router no longer depends on aggregator internals.
- Wired the MCP dashboard search and inspector surfaces to the MCP router-backed tool inventory and embedded the shared traffic inspector directly in the inspector view.
- Switched the MCP dashboard search page to the dedicated `mcp.searchTools` contract and embedded the live `TrafficInspector` into the MCP inspector page so the new router traffic/search APIs are operator-visible.
- Added reusable MCP client-config sync support for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code, including resolved target discovery, previewable exported configs, and router-backed write operations.
- Added an MCP settings dashboard surface for selecting supported clients, previewing the generated config JSON, and writing Borg-managed MCP config files directly from the UI.

### Fixed
- Fixed the dashboard tRPC compatibility route in `apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` so GET/query-style `mcpServers.get` requests now read their tRPC input from the URL `input` param during local fallback, which stops React Query from receiving `undefined` for local pseudo-managed server detail queries.
- Fixed `pnpm run dev` on Windows/Tabby so the `scripts/dev_tabby_ready.mjs` launcher now actually executes its readiness loop instead of returning immediately when the direct-execution guard miscompares `import.meta.url` against `process.argv[1]`.
- Fixed the excluded `apps/borg-extension` build path enough for root aggregation by adding the missing `eciesjs` dependency in `packages/env`, correcting Rollup plugin typings in `packages/hmr`, and tightening stale session supervisor runtime contracts in `packages/core/src/lib/trpc-core.ts` plus `packages/core/src/routers/sessionRouter.ts` so the dashboard session pages and root build compile cleanly again.
- Fixed `borg start`/root `pnpm run dev` startup wiring so the CLI now launches Borg's real Core orchestrator and tRPC control plane instead of only instantiating `MCPServer` without starting the HTTP API, which restores `startupStatus`, `memory.getAgentStats`, and `browser.status` readiness probes during dev boot.
- Fixed the web tRPC upstream preference order to probe the CLI dev control-plane port (`3100`) before the legacy `4000` path, so Windows dev environments where Docker/WSL already owns `4000` still route dashboard startup, memory, and browser queries into Borg Core.
- Excluded the legacy nested `apps/borg-extension` monorepo from the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so root `pnpm run dev` no longer parses that package's incompatible standalone `turbo.json` while bringing up Borg's main core/web/extension stack.
- Fixed `packages/core/src/mcp/MCPAggregator.ts` so ordinary downstream tool-call failures no longer mark an otherwise healthy MCP server as fully errored; the router now preserves connected status while still recording the failure in server state and traffic history.
- Fixed the dashboard tRPC proxy in `apps/web` so it now probes Borg Core's actual default tRPC endpoint on `http://127.0.0.1:4000/trpc` before legacy MCP bridge fallbacks, which restores mutations like `mcpServers.bulkImport` instead of surfacing a proxy-generated 502.
- Fixed the dashboard MCP query bridge in `apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` so modern procedure batches (`mcp.listServers`, `mcp.listTools`, `mcp.getStatus`) now fall back through the compatibility bridge instead of incorrectly returning `502 Bad Gateway` when the upstream is unavailable.
- Fixed the Next.js app-route typing contract in `apps/web` by moving `resolveUpstreamBases` out of `src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/` into `src/lib/trpc-upstream.ts`, which removes the illegal extra route export and restores clean webpack builds.
- Made root `pnpm install` succeed on Windows by replacing the `packages/MCP-SuperAssistant` bash-based `copy_env` postinstall step with a cross-platform Node-based copy.
- Extracted the `packages/MCP-SuperAssistant` `copy_env` postinstall helper into a dedicated Node script with focused regression coverage so the clean-install fix remains testable.
- Excluded the duplicate `apps/vscode` workspace from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so it no longer collides with the canonical `packages/vscode` extension package during dependency installation.
- Removed the obsolete Compose `version` field from `docker-compose.yml` to eliminate a startup warning under modern Docker Compose.
- Ignored Next.js `.next-dev/` output in `.gitignore` so local dashboard runs no longer dirty the repository with generated artifacts.
- Corrected the web runtime stage in `Dockerfile` to expose Next.js' actual internal port (`3000`) instead of the host-mapped dashboard port.
- Declared `date-fns` in `apps/web/package.json` so the Dockerized dashboard build resolves the `LogEntry` timestamp formatter the same way the local workspace build does.
- Replaced the stock Next.js metadata in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` so the live dashboard no longer shows the `Create Next App` title.
- Excluded nested `.borg/worktrees/**` copies from the root `vitest.config.ts` discovery and coverage paths so workspace-root validation no longer pulls duplicate shadow tests into the main suite.

### Changed
- Hardened provider fallback in `packages/ai` so model selection tracks cooldowns per `provider:model`, honors provider preference ordering, excludes already-failed candidates during retries, and forces local fallback when quota budgets are exceeded.
- Improved `LLMService` recoverable error detection for quota, rate-limit, timeout, and transient connectivity failures, then retried against the next eligible provider/model instead of reusing the same failed candidate.
- Synchronized source-side JavaScript runtime files for `LLMService`, `ModelSelector`, and `ForgeService` with the updated TypeScript logic so NodeNext tests and runtime imports resolve consistently.

### Added
- Added `packages/ai/src/ModelSelector.test.ts` coverage for provider preference, provider-specific cooldown handling, and budget-triggered local fallback.
- Added `packages/ai/src/LLMService.test.ts` coverage for recoverable provider failure fallback and fatal unsupported-provider behavior.

  - Added Missions UI "Filtered Risk Facets" card to surface real-time aggregate context alongside mission triage controls.

## [2.7.68] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **Phase 107: Configurable High-Risk Threshold Control (Server-Driven)**
  - Added a configurable Missions risk threshold input (`0..100`) with preset chips (`30/50/70`) for triage tuning.
  - Updated high-risk mode labeling to reflect the active threshold dynamically.
  - Kept filtering server-enforced by passing the configured threshold to `swarm.getMissionRiskRows.minRisk`.

## [2.7.67] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **Phase 106: High-Risk Mission Focus Filter (Server-Enforced)**
  - Extended `swarm.getMissionRiskRows` with optional `minRisk` filtering (`0-100`) for backend-enforced governance triage.
  - Added Missions UI toggle for **High-Risk Only (≥50)** that drives API query filtering instead of local-only filtering.
  - Preserved compatibility with existing status/sort controls while improving deterministic cross-client mission ordering.

## [2.7.66] - 2026-03-04

  - Added mission-level governance triage controls in Swarm Missions: status filter (`all/active/completed/failed/paused`) and risk-first vs recent-first ordering.
  - Added per-mission derived governance indicators (`Risk <score>`, `24h <denied-count>`) to accelerate operator prioritization.
  - Added filter-aware empty-state messaging when no missions match current governance controls.

## [2.7.64] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **Phase 103: Swarm Mission Risk Trend & Status Analytics**
  - Extended `swarm.getMissionRiskSummary` with `statusBreakdown`, `deniedEventsLast24h`, and `deniedEventsByHour24` for time-window governance analytics.
  - Updated the Swarm Missions dashboard to show 24-hour denied-event totals, mission status distribution, and a 24-hour denied-event trend sparkline.

## [2.7.63] - 2026-03-04
### Added

  - Added mission-level UI summary block for effective tool policy and policy warnings in the Swarm Missions panel.

## [2.7.59] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **Phase 98: Swarm Dashboard Policy & Denial Telemetry UI**
  - Added `toolPolicy` allow/deny input controls to the Swarm launch panel.
  - Added launch feedback rendering for `effectiveToolPolicy`, `policyWarnings`, `missionId`, and `taskCount`.
  - Added mission task-level denied-tool telemetry display (`deniedToolEvents`) with counts and recent event details.

## [2.7.58] - 2026-03-04
### Added

  - Added canonical policy normalization (`normalizeSwarmToolPolicy`) with trim/dedupe behavior and deny-overrides-allow semantics.
  - Added overlap warnings for contradictory allow/deny entries.
  - `startSwarm` now returns `effectiveToolPolicy` and `policyWarnings` for UI/client visibility into applied execution constraints.

## [2.7.57] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **Phase 96: Swarm Tool Permission Boundaries**
  - Added mission-level tool policy support (`allow` / `deny`) to swarm start input and task decomposition flow.
  - Propagated tool policy through `SwarmOrchestrator` task offers and recursive sub-mission decomposition.
  - Enforced allow/deny boundaries in `McpWorkerAgent` tool-call loop with explicit deny reasons.

## [2.7.56] - 2026-03-04
### Changed
- **Documentation and version synchronization pass**:
  - Synced canonical version references across `VERSION`, `VERSION.md`, and top-level operational docs.
  - Updated `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, and `STATUS.md` headers to reflect Phase 95 completion and current release context.
  - Updated `docs/SUBMODULE_DASHBOARD.md` version context to align with the canonical release.
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` quick-link version reference and refreshed `HANDOFF_ANTIGRAVITY.md` with this session delta.

## [2.7.55] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **Phase 95: Swarm Git Worktree Isolation**
  - Integrated `GitWorktreeManager` into `SwarmOrchestrator`. Coding tasks tagged with `requirements: ['coder']` now automatically receive an isolated git worktree via `createTaskEnvironment(taskId)` before dispatch.
  - The worktree path is propagated to the `TASK_OFFER` mesh payload so downstream agents operate in the isolated directory.
  - Worktrees are cleaned up via `cleanupTaskEnvironment(taskId)` after task completion (success or failure).
  - Both `swarmRouter.ts` construction sites now pass `gitWorktreeManager` from `MCPServer`.

## [2.7.54] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- **Phase 94: Sub-Agent Task Routing**
  - Updated `SwarmOrchestrator` task decomposition logic to inspect task intent (e.g., "code", "research") and attach explicit `requirements` properties to the sub-objects.
  - Implemented `MeshCoderAgent` and `MeshResearcherAgent` inheriting from `SpecializedAgent` to serve as autonomous listeners on the Local Mesh bus.
  - Updated `MCPServer` to instantiate and expose these specialized agents. Task Offers tagged with specific agent requirements are now specifically routed to and bid upon by the most appropriate agent instance across the decentralized mesh, bypassing the generic `McpWorkerAgent`.

## [2.7.53] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- **Phase 93: P2P Artifact Federation**
  - Added `ARTIFACT_READ_REQUEST` and `ARTIFACT_READ_RESPONSE` to `SwarmMessageType`.
  - Added event listener to `MCPServer` to handle incoming artifact read requests and serve local files if they exist.
  - Refactored `MCPServer.executeTool` to intercept `read_file` calls that fail with `ENOENT`. If a local file is missing, the node broadcasts an artifact request to the Mesh and transparently resolves the read using remote node data.

## [2.7.52] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- **Phase 92: P2P Multi-Node Worker Dispatch**: Solved redundant task execution across the mesh network by implementing a centralized assignment handshake. `SwarmOrchestrator` now broadcasts a `TASK_OFFER` and waits a 1-second Bidding Window to collect incoming `TASK_BID` payloads from peer nodes. It selects the winning Agent based on reported CPU/Load constraints, and issues a standard `TASK_ASSIGN` direct message, preventing multiple workers from burning AI tokens on the same sub-task.

## [2.7.51] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 91: Swarm Agent Tool Execution (MCP)**: Empowered Swarm Worker Agents with full MCP Tool Execution capabilities. Created `McpWorkerAgent.ts` which dynamically maps requested tools (e.g., `read_file`, `browser_screenshot`) to LLM Function Calling JSON schemas, executing tools autonomously in a feedback loop until the sub-task is complete. Updated the Swarm Dashboard UI to allow users to specify a comma-separated list of `tools` to inject into the `TASK_OFFER` mesh broadcast.

## [2.7.50] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 90: Swarm Shared Context (Stateful Missions)**: Introduced a mission-level JSON Key-Value store to enable context sharing between independently operating Swarm Tasks. `SwarmOrchestrator` now injects `mission.context` into `TASK_OFFER` payloads. Agents can mutate global mission state by returning `_contextUpdate` in their JSON output, allowing cascading task flows. The Swarm Dashboard now features an interactive `<details>` JSON viewer summarizing `Shared Mission Context` per mission.

## [2.7.49] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 89: Swarm Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Implemented dynamic priority quotas inside `SwarmOrchestrator.ts`. The main execution loop now scans the global `MissionService` state, aggressively throttling the local instance batch size (e.g. down to 20%) if higher-priority tasks are active from other missions. This guarantees critical high-priority missions are never starved by massive backlogs of low-priority tasks.

## [2.7.48] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 88: Swarm Consensus Voting (v2)**: Implemented multi-agent verification workflows within `SwarmOrchestrator`. Tasks now transition to a `verifying` state and emit a `VERIFY_OFFER` over the Node Mesh. A peer agent verifies the task result, returning a `VERIFY_RESULT`. Failed verifications result in task slashing (`slashed: true`) and retries. Updated Swarm Dashboard to visualize the new `verifying` status and slashing events.

## [2.7.47] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 87: Swarm Inter-Agent Communication**: Added `DIRECT_MESSAGE` routing to the `MeshService`. Added a `sendDirectMessage` mutation to the tRPC swarm router and implemented a testing UI inside the Swarm Dashboard Telemetry panel for targeted peer-to-peer payload delivery.

## [2.7.46] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 86: Swarm Adaptive Rate Limiting**: 
- Added `RateLimiter.ts` employing a token bucket algorithm to pace Mesh network API requests based on estimated tokens per minute (TPM) and requests per minute (RPM).
- Integrated adaptive backoff into `SwarmOrchestrator` to catch provider 429s and pause execution gracefully. Added pulsing "THROTTLED" status to Swarm Dashboard.

## [2.7.45] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 85: Swarm Resource Awareness**: Implemented real-time token and memory usage tracking for tasks and missions. Added resource limit enforcement (max tokens per mission) and usage visualization in the Swarm Dashboard.

## [2.7.44] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 83: Swarm Self-Correction (Missions)**
- Implemented automatic retry logic in `SwarmOrchestrator` (max 3 retries).
- Integrated `HealerService` for automated repair of failed swarm tasks.
- Updated Swarm Dashboard with retry badges and "healing" status pulse.

## [2.7.42] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 82: Recursive Swarm Decomposition**

- Added recursive task "explosion" logic to `SwarmOrchestrator`.
- Updated Swarm Dashboard with "Explode" buttons and nested mission labels.
- Added `awaiting_subtask` status for parent tasks in hierarchical workflows.

## [2.7.41] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 81: Swarm Task Recovery & Manual Intervention**
- Implemented `resumeMission` in `MissionService` to recover failed swarm goals.
- Added HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) gating for sensitive tasks (delete, deploy, etc.).
- Integrated manual "Approve/Reject" controls into the Swarm Dashboard.
- Added active orchestrator tracking in `swarmRouter` for live mission interaction.

## [2.7.40] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 80: Swarm Mission Persistence & Capabilities**
- Implemented `MissionService` for JSON-backed persistent storage of high-level goals.
- Enabled mesh-wide "Capability Advertisement" in heartbeats for tool discovery.
- Added "Missions" history tab to the Swarm Dashboard.
- Integrated `MissionService` lifecycle events into the Telemetry feed.

## [2.7.39] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 79: Swarm Event Visualization Engine**
- Integrated real-time P2P traffic monitoring via SSE over port 3001.
- Added a high-fidelity "Telemetry" dashboard in `@borg/web` with Framer Motion animations.
- Wired internal `MeshService` traffic to the central `MCPServer` `eventBus` for visualization.

## [2.7.38] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Phase 78: Mesh Network Realization (Redis)**: Migrated `MeshService.ts` from a local-only simulation to a distributed Pub/Sub architecture using `ioredis`. Local node processes now detect standard `REDIS_URL` secrets to fuse instances to a `borg:swarm:mesh` channel, enabling swarm logic across server instances. Developed dual-topic stream architecture natively blocking pub/sub echo storms.

## [2.7.37] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Phase 77: Autonomous Agent Mesh Network**: Implemented `MeshService.ts` to act as a decentralized P2P event bus, paving the way for cross-node multi-agent Swarm deployments.
- **SwarmProtocol**: Introduced typed JSON-RPC style `SwarmMessage` interface mapping capability queries, task offers, and remote execution results.
- **Mesh Swarm Dispatcher**: Refactored `SwarmOrchestrator.executeTask` to broadcast generic `TASK_OFFER` events onto the Mesh Network, waiting for any capable peer agent before falling back to local simulation.
- **SpecializedAgent Reactivation**: Fully restored `MeshService` capability routing within `SpecializedAgent.ts`, removing hardcoded stubs.

## [2.7.36] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Multi-Turn Conversation History**: Extended `LLMService.generateText` with `history` option, wired into all 7 providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Forge, Ollama, LM Studio) for full multi-turn context preservation.
- **Real Swarm Intelligence**: Replaced all simulated stubs in the swarm package:
  - `DebateProtocol.ts` — per-supervisor Proponent/Opponent/Judge adversarial debate via Council API
  - `ConsensusEngine.ts` — multi-model parallel dispatch with synthesis LLM scoring
  - `SwarmOrchestrator.ts` — Council debate decomposition + session polling execution

### Changed
- **Model Updates**: `ClaudeAgent` → `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `GeminiAgent` → `gemini-2.5-pro`
- **Version Bump**: Incremented version to 2.7.36.

## [2.7.35] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **MetaMCP Backend Silent Startup Hang**: Root-caused and fixed a deadlock where `tsx watch` silently hung during ESM module evaluation. The underlying trigger was a `SyntaxError` from 8 missing table exports in the SQLite schema (`dockerSessionsTable`, `auditLogsTable`, `memoriesTable`, `policiesTable`, `toolCallLogsTable`, `toolSetsTable`, `toolSetItemsTable`, `savedScriptsTable`). Instead of surfacing the error, `tsx watch`'s AST parser entered an infinite loop.
- **SQLite Schema Parity**: Migrated all 8 missing PostgreSQL table definitions to SQLite equivalents in `schema-sqlite.ts`, converting `uuid()` → `text()`, `timestamp()` → `integer({mode:"timestamp"})`, `jsonb()` → `text({mode:"json"})`, and `pgEnum()` → TypeScript `as const` arrays.
- **Dev Watcher Stability**: Replaced `tsx watch` with Node.js native `--watch` flag (`node --watch --import tsx`) in the backend `package.json` dev script. Node's C++ ESM graph resolver handles circular dependencies gracefully, completely bypassing the `tsx` AST parser deadlock.
- **Drizzle Migration**: Generated clean `drizzle-sqlite/0001_unknown_tyrannus.sql` migration covering all 24 SQLite tables.

### Changed
- **Version Bump**: Incremented version to 2.7.35.

### Verified
- **Full Dev Readiness**: All 4 critical services pass `verify_dev_readiness.mjs` in strict mode:
  - ✅ `borg-web` (port 3000)
  - ✅ `metamcp-frontend` (port 12008)
  - ✅ `metamcp-backend` (port 12009, `/health` → 200 OK)
  - ✅ `autopilot-server` (port 3847)

## [2.7.34] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Phase 76: Deep Ecosystem Integration (Open-WebUI)**:
  - Added `external/open-webui` as the 7th submodule, integrating the robust conversational interface natively into the workspace.
  - **Frontend Sync**: Scaffolded `/dashboard/webui` Next.js page, embedding the interface into Borg's primary navigation system (`nav-config.ts`), marking it as a top-level native integration tab.

### Changed
- **Submodule Assimilation Sprint**: Formally initialized the four core foundational submodules (`MetaMCP`, `MCP-SuperAssistant`, `jules-autopilot`, and `claude-mem`) into the project infrastructure. Updated `VISION.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `DEPLOY.md` to reflect the newly integrated Deep Submodule assimilation plan.
- **Version Bump**: Incremented version to 2.7.27.

## [2.7.26] - 2026-02-26

- Observed:
  - stale lock removal log
  - successful startup (`Ready`) on selected port

## [2.7.12] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Web dev launcher arg forwarding on Windows/PNPM**:
  - Updated `apps/web/scripts/dev.mjs` to strip `--` delimiter tokens from forwarded script args.

  - Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `typecheck` job to run strict core typecheck (`pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit`).
  - Removed soft-fail semantics from these checks by replacing brittle commands that were failing due workspace-wide task/tooling gaps.

### Validation

- Verified local command parity for CI checks:
  - `pnpm run check:placeholders` ✅
  - `pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit` ✅

## [2.7.5] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **CI-integrated release gate**:
  - Wired `pnpm run check:release-gate:ci` into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as a dedicated required job (`Release Gate (CI)`).

  - Gate now enforces three checks in sequence:
    1. Strict machine-readable readiness (`scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs --strict-json`)
    2. Placeholder regression scan (`check:placeholders`)
    3. Core TypeScript validation (`pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit`)

### Changed

- **Readiness JSON modes**:
  - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with `--strict-json` mode.
  - `--strict-json` guarantees JSON output shape and strict exit semantics for automation consumers.
