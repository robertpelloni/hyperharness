# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.7.55] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **Phase 95: Swarm Git Worktree Isolation**
  - Integrated `GitWorktreeManager` into `SwarmOrchestrator`. Coding tasks tagged with `requirements: ['coder']` now automatically receive an isolated git worktree via `createTaskEnvironment(taskId)` before dispatch.
  - The worktree path is propagated to the `TASK_OFFER` mesh payload so downstream agents operate in the isolated directory.
  - Worktrees are cleaned up via `cleanupTaskEnvironment(taskId)` after task completion (success or failure).
  - Both `swarmRouter.ts` construction sites now pass `gitWorktreeManager` from `MCPServer`.

## [2.7.54] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- **Phase 94: Sub-Agent Task Routing**
  - Updated `SwarmOrchestrator` task decomposition logic to inspect task intent (e.g., "code", "research") and attach explicit `requirements` properties to the sub-objects.
  - Implemented `MeshCoderAgent` and `MeshResearcherAgent` inheriting from `SpecializedAgent` to serve as autonomous listeners on the Local Mesh bus.
  - Updated `MCPServer` to instantiate and expose these specialized agents. Task Offers tagged with specific agent requirements are now specifically routed to and bid upon by the most appropriate agent instance across the decentralized mesh, bypassing the generic `McpWorkerAgent`.

## [2.7.53] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- **Phase 93: P2P Artifact Federation**
  - Added `ARTIFACT_READ_REQUEST` and `ARTIFACT_READ_RESPONSE` to `SwarmMessageType`.
  - Added event listener to `MCPServer` to handle incoming artifact read requests and serve local files if they exist.
  - Refactored `MCPServer.executeTool` to intercept `read_file` calls that fail with `ENOENT`. If a local file is missing, the node broadcasts an artifact request to the Mesh and transparently resolves the read using remote node data.

## [2.7.52] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- **Phase 92: P2P Multi-Node Worker Dispatch**: Solved redundant task execution across the mesh network by implementing a centralized assignment handshake. `SwarmOrchestrator` now broadcasts a `TASK_OFFER` and waits a 1-second Bidding Window to collect incoming `TASK_BID` payloads from peer nodes. It selects the winning Agent based on reported CPU/Load constraints, and issues a standard `TASK_ASSIGN` direct message, preventing multiple workers from burning AI tokens on the same sub-task.

## [2.7.51] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 91: Swarm Agent Tool Execution (MCP)**: Empowered Swarm Worker Agents with full MCP Tool Execution capabilities. Created `McpWorkerAgent.ts` which dynamically maps requested tools (e.g., `read_file`, `browser_screenshot`) to LLM Function Calling JSON schemas, executing tools autonomously in a feedback loop until the sub-task is complete. Updated the Swarm Dashboard UI to allow users to specify a comma-separated list of `tools` to inject into the `TASK_OFFER` mesh broadcast.

## [2.7.50] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 90: Swarm Shared Context (Stateful Missions)**: Introduced a mission-level JSON Key-Value store to enable context sharing between independently operating Swarm Tasks. `SwarmOrchestrator` now injects `mission.context` into `TASK_OFFER` payloads. Agents can mutate global mission state by returning `_contextUpdate` in their JSON output, allowing cascading task flows. The Swarm Dashboard now features an interactive `<details>` JSON viewer summarizing `Shared Mission Context` per mission.

## [2.7.49] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 89: Swarm Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Implemented dynamic priority quotas inside `SwarmOrchestrator.ts`. The main execution loop now scans the global `MissionService` state, aggressively throttling the local instance batch size (e.g. down to 20%) if higher-priority tasks are active from other missions. This guarantees critical high-priority missions are never starved by massive backlogs of low-priority tasks.

## [2.7.48] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 88: Swarm Consensus Voting (v2)**: Implemented multi-agent verification workflows within `SwarmOrchestrator`. Tasks now transition to a `verifying` state and emit a `VERIFY_OFFER` over the Node Mesh. A peer agent verifies the task result, returning a `VERIFY_RESULT`. Failed verifications result in task slashing (`slashed: true`) and retries. Updated Swarm Dashboard to visualize the new `verifying` status and slashing events.

## [2.7.47] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 87: Swarm Inter-Agent Communication**: Added `DIRECT_MESSAGE` routing to the `MeshService`. Added a `sendDirectMessage` mutation to the tRPC swarm router and implemented a testing UI inside the Swarm Dashboard Telemetry panel for targeted peer-to-peer payload delivery.

## [2.7.46] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 86: Swarm Adaptive Rate Limiting**: 
- Added `RateLimiter.ts` employing a token bucket algorithm to pace Mesh network API requests based on estimated tokens per minute (TPM) and requests per minute (RPM).
- Integrated adaptive backoff into `SwarmOrchestrator` to catch provider 429s and pause execution gracefully. Added pulsing "THROTTLED" status to Swarm Dashboard.

## [2.7.45] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Phase 85: Swarm Resource Awareness**: Implemented real-time token and memory usage tracking for tasks and missions. Added resource limit enforcement (max tokens per mission) and usage visualization in the Swarm Dashboard.

## [2.7.44] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 83: Swarm Self-Correction (Missions)**
- Implemented automatic retry logic in `SwarmOrchestrator` (max 3 retries).
- Integrated `HealerService` for automated repair of failed swarm tasks.
- Updated Swarm Dashboard with retry badges and "healing" status pulse.

## [2.7.42] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 82: Recursive Swarm Decomposition**
- Implemented hierarchical mission support with `parentId` and `subMissionId`.
- Added recursive task "explosion" logic to `SwarmOrchestrator`.
- Updated Swarm Dashboard with "Explode" buttons and nested mission labels.
- Added `awaiting_subtask` status for parent tasks in hierarchical workflows.

## [2.7.41] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 81: Swarm Task Recovery & Manual Intervention**
- Implemented `resumeMission` in `MissionService` to recover failed swarm goals.
- Added HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) gating for sensitive tasks (delete, deploy, etc.).
- Integrated manual "Approve/Reject" controls into the Swarm Dashboard.
- Added active orchestrator tracking in `swarmRouter` for live mission interaction.

## [2.7.40] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 80: Swarm Mission Persistence & Capabilities**
- Implemented `MissionService` for JSON-backed persistent storage of high-level goals.
- Enabled mesh-wide "Capability Advertisement" in heartbeats for tool discovery.
- Added "Missions" history tab to the Swarm Dashboard.
- Integrated `MissionService` lifecycle events into the Telemetry feed.

## [2.7.39] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Phase 79: Swarm Event Visualization Engine**
- Integrated real-time P2P traffic monitoring via SSE over port 3001.
- Added a high-fidelity "Telemetry" dashboard in `@borg/web` with Framer Motion animations.
- Wired internal `MeshService` traffic to the central `MCPServer` `eventBus` for visualization.

## [2.7.38] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Phase 78: Mesh Network Realization (Redis)**: Migrated `MeshService.ts` from a local-only simulation to a distributed Pub/Sub architecture using `ioredis`. Local node processes now detect standard `REDIS_URL` secrets to fuse instances to a `borg:swarm:mesh` channel, enabling swarm logic across server instances. Developed dual-topic stream architecture natively blocking pub/sub echo storms.

## [2.7.37] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Phase 77: Autonomous Agent Mesh Network**: Implemented `MeshService.ts` to act as a decentralized P2P event bus, paving the way for cross-node multi-agent Swarm deployments.
- **SwarmProtocol**: Introduced typed JSON-RPC style `SwarmMessage` interface mapping capability queries, task offers, and remote execution results.
- **Mesh Swarm Dispatcher**: Refactored `SwarmOrchestrator.executeTask` to broadcast generic `TASK_OFFER` events onto the Mesh Network, waiting for any capable peer agent before falling back to local simulation.
- **SpecializedAgent Reactivation**: Fully restored `MeshService` capability routing within `SpecializedAgent.ts`, removing hardcoded stubs.

## [2.7.36] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Multi-Turn Conversation History**: Extended `LLMService.generateText` with `history` option, wired into all 7 providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Forge, Ollama, LM Studio) for full multi-turn context preservation.
- **Real Swarm Intelligence**: Replaced all simulated stubs in the swarm package:
  - `DebateProtocol.ts` — per-supervisor Proponent/Opponent/Judge adversarial debate via Council API
  - `ConsensusEngine.ts` — multi-model parallel dispatch with synthesis LLM scoring
  - `SwarmOrchestrator.ts` — Council debate decomposition + session polling execution

### Changed
- **Model Updates**: `ClaudeAgent` → `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `GeminiAgent` → `gemini-2.5-pro`
- **Version Bump**: Incremented version to 2.7.36.

## [2.7.35] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **MetaMCP Backend Silent Startup Hang**: Root-caused and fixed a deadlock where `tsx watch` silently hung during ESM module evaluation. The underlying trigger was a `SyntaxError` from 8 missing table exports in the SQLite schema (`dockerSessionsTable`, `auditLogsTable`, `memoriesTable`, `policiesTable`, `toolCallLogsTable`, `toolSetsTable`, `toolSetItemsTable`, `savedScriptsTable`). Instead of surfacing the error, `tsx watch`'s AST parser entered an infinite loop.
- **SQLite Schema Parity**: Migrated all 8 missing PostgreSQL table definitions to SQLite equivalents in `schema-sqlite.ts`, converting `uuid()` → `text()`, `timestamp()` → `integer({mode:"timestamp"})`, `jsonb()` → `text({mode:"json"})`, and `pgEnum()` → TypeScript `as const` arrays.
- **Dev Watcher Stability**: Replaced `tsx watch` with Node.js native `--watch` flag (`node --watch --import tsx`) in the backend `package.json` dev script. Node's C++ ESM graph resolver handles circular dependencies gracefully, completely bypassing the `tsx` AST parser deadlock.
- **Drizzle Migration**: Generated clean `drizzle-sqlite/0001_unknown_tyrannus.sql` migration covering all 24 SQLite tables.

### Changed
- **Version Bump**: Incremented version to 2.7.35.

### Verified
- **Full Dev Readiness**: All 4 critical services pass `verify_dev_readiness.mjs` in strict mode:
  - ✅ `borg-web` (port 3000)
  - ✅ `metamcp-frontend` (port 12008)
  - ✅ `metamcp-backend` (port 12009, `/health` → 200 OK)
  - ✅ `autopilot-server` (port 3847)

## [2.7.34] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Phase 76: Deep Ecosystem Integration (Open-WebUI)**:
  - Added `external/open-webui` as the 7th submodule, integrating the robust conversational interface natively into the workspace.
  - **Frontend Sync**: Scaffolded `/dashboard/webui` Next.js page, embedding the interface into Borg's primary navigation system (`nav-config.ts`), marking it as a top-level native integration tab.

## [2.7.13] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Web dev stale lock auto-recovery**:
  - Updated `apps/web/scripts/dev.mjs` to remove `.next-dev/dev/lock` only when the selected port is free.
  - Prevents false startup failures after interrupted dev sessions while avoiding lock deletion for active instances.

### Validation

- Synthetic stale lock test: created `apps/web/.next-dev/dev/lock`, then ran:
  - `pnpm -C apps/web run dev -- --port 3561`
- Observed:
  - stale lock removal log
  - successful startup (`Ready`) on selected port

## [2.7.12] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Web dev launcher arg forwarding on Windows/PNPM**:
  - Updated `apps/web/scripts/dev.mjs` to strip `--` delimiter tokens from forwarded script args.
  - This prevents invalid Next.js startup invocations like `... apps/web --port` when running `pnpm -C apps/web run dev -- --port <n>`.

- **Web tracing-root stability hardening**:
  - Updated `apps/web/next.config.ts` to canonicalize `outputFileTracingRoot` using `path.resolve(...)`.
  - Reduces false workspace-root inference in environments with multiple parent lockfiles.

### Validation

  - Updated `check:release-gate:ci` to run with `--skip-readiness --with-turbo-lint`.

### Validation

- `pnpm run check:release-gate:ci` ✅
- Scoped `lint:turbo` check executed inside gate and passed.

## [2.7.9] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- **Turbo lint scope stabilization**:
  - Updated root `lint:turbo` script to temporarily exclude `@borg/web` in addition to existing exclusions.
  - This isolates known legacy lint rule debt in `apps/web` while preserving monorepo lint signal for the remaining workspace packages.

### Validation

- `pnpm run lint:turbo` ✅ (exit code `0`)

## [2.7.8] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- **Root lint command stabilization**:
  - Updated root `package.json` `lint` script to run deterministic placeholder guard (`check:placeholders`).

  - Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `lint` job to run strict placeholder regression guard (`pnpm run check:placeholders`).
  - Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `typecheck` job to run strict core typecheck (`pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit`).
  - Removed soft-fail semantics from these checks by replacing brittle commands that were failing due workspace-wide task/tooling gaps.

### Validation

- Verified local command parity for CI checks:
  - `pnpm run check:placeholders` ✅
  - `pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit` ✅

## [2.7.5] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **CI-integrated release gate**:
  - Wired `pnpm run check:release-gate:ci` into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as a dedicated required job (`Release Gate (CI)`).
  - Wired `pnpm run check:release-gate:ci` into `.github/workflows/release.yml` before test/build steps.

### Changed

- **Release gate CI mode support**:
  - Extended `scripts/check_release_gate.mjs` with `--skip-readiness` for environments without live local services.
  - Added root script alias `check:release-gate:ci` in `package.json`.

## [2.7.4] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Strict release gate command**:
  - Added `scripts/check_release_gate.mjs` for deterministic pre-release validation.
  - Added root script `check:release-gate` in `package.json`.
  - Gate now enforces three checks in sequence:
    1. Strict machine-readable readiness (`scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs --strict-json`)
    2. Placeholder regression scan (`check:placeholders`)
    3. Core TypeScript validation (`pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit`)

### Changed

- **Readiness JSON modes**:
  - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with `--strict-json` mode.
  - `--strict-json` guarantees JSON output shape and strict exit semantics for automation consumers.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Readiness startup-race tolerance**:
  - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with retry/backoff controls:

  - JSON payload now includes retry metadata (`retries`, `retryDelayMs`).

### Fixed

- **MetaMCP backend JSON-only startup log noise**:
  - Updated `external/MetaMCP/apps/backend/src/lib/mcp-config.service.ts` to skip DB import migration when DB is intentionally unconfigured.
  - Replaced misleading startup error path with explicit informational JSON-only mode handling.

- **Strict local readiness regression gate**:
  - Verified strict readiness pass across Borg web, MetaMCP frontend/backend, and autopilot server once services are active.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Readiness JSON Output Mode**:
  - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with `--json` output for machine-readable CI/dashboard ingestion.

  - Added root script `check:dev-readiness` in `package.json`.
  - Verifies live readiness across Borg Web, MetaMCP frontend/backend, and OpenCode Autopilot server with deterministic endpoint checks.
  - Supports strict mode (non-zero on critical failures) and `--soft` mode for diagnostic runs.

### Fixed

- **Web Dev Stability**:
  - Stabilized `NEXT_DIST_DIR` strategy in web dev launchers to reduce per-port tsconfig churn and stale include regressions.
  - Normalized web tsconfig includes to preserve stable `.next-dev` type globs.

- **OpenCode Autopilot Server Bind Resilience**:
  - Added startup preflight diagnostics for candidate ports in `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/scripts/dev-auto.mjs`.
  - Added runtime `Bun.serve` fallback logic in `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/src/index.ts` to recover from bind-time `EADDRINUSE` race conditions.
  - Fixed server typecheck Bun typings mismatch by aligning to `types: ["bun"]` in `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/tsconfig.json`.

### Added

- **Scalable Link Ingestion Sync**:
  - Added `scripts/sync_master_index.mjs` to normalize and synchronize `BORG_MASTER_INDEX.jsonc` from `scripts/resources-list.json` and `scripts/ingestion-status.json`.
  - Added `scripts/ingestion-status.json` for explicit processed/pending/failed outcome tracking and failure retry seeds.
  - Added root script alias: `npm run index:sync`.

### Fixed

- **API Router Refactoring (Database Decoupling)**:
  - Refactored `toolsRouter` to use `ToolRegistry` instead of direct DB storage, resolving persistent type errors and aligning with MetaMCP architecture.
  - Refactored `savedScriptsRouter` to use `JsonConfigProvider`, utilizing `mcp.json` as the single source of truth for script storage.
  - Standardized tool naming convention to `server__tool` across `MetaMCPController` and `ToolRegistry`.
  - Created `common-utils.ts` to fully decouple utility functions from lingering database dependencies.

### Changed
