# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.7.4] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Strict release gate command**:
  - Added `scripts/check_release_gate.mjs` for deterministic pre-release validation.
  - Added root script `check:release-gate` in `package.json`.
  - Gate now enforces three checks in sequence:
    1. Strict machine-readable readiness (`scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs --strict-json`)
    2. Placeholder regression scan (`check:placeholders`)
    3. Core TypeScript validation (`pnpm -C packages/core exec tsc --noEmit`)

### Changed

- **Readiness JSON modes**:
  - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with `--strict-json` mode.
  - `--strict-json` guarantees JSON output shape and strict exit semantics for automation consumers.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Readiness startup-race tolerance**:
  - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with retry/backoff controls:
    - `READINESS_RETRIES` (default: `2`)
    - `READINESS_RETRY_DELAY_MS` (default: `500`)
  - JSON payload now includes retry metadata (`retries`, `retryDelayMs`).

### Fixed

- **MetaMCP backend JSON-only startup log noise**:
  - Updated `external/MetaMCP/apps/backend/src/lib/mcp-config.service.ts` to skip DB import migration when DB is intentionally unconfigured.
  - Replaced misleading startup error path with explicit informational JSON-only mode handling.

- **Strict local readiness regression gate**:
  - Verified strict readiness pass across Borg web, MetaMCP frontend/backend, and autopilot server once services are active.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Readiness JSON Output Mode**:
  - Extended `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs` with `--json` output for machine-readable CI/dashboard ingestion.
  - JSON payload now includes pass/fail state, checked timestamp, mode, timeout, and per-service endpoint/port/status metadata.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Cross-Service Dev Readiness Checker**:
  - Added `scripts/verify_dev_readiness.mjs`.
  - Added root script `check:dev-readiness` in `package.json`.
  - Verifies live readiness across Borg Web, MetaMCP frontend/backend, and OpenCode Autopilot server with deterministic endpoint checks.
  - Supports strict mode (non-zero on critical failures) and `--soft` mode for diagnostic runs.

### Fixed

- **Web Dev Stability**:
  - Stabilized `NEXT_DIST_DIR` strategy in web dev launchers to reduce per-port tsconfig churn and stale include regressions.
  - Normalized web tsconfig includes to preserve stable `.next-dev` type globs.

- **OpenCode Autopilot Server Bind Resilience**:
  - Added startup preflight diagnostics for candidate ports in `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/scripts/dev-auto.mjs`.
  - Added runtime `Bun.serve` fallback logic in `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/src/index.ts` to recover from bind-time `EADDRINUSE` race conditions.
  - Fixed server typecheck Bun typings mismatch by aligning to `types: ["bun"]` in `packages/opencode-autopilot/packages/server/tsconfig.json`.

### Added

- **Scalable Link Ingestion Sync**:
  - Added `scripts/sync_master_index.mjs` to normalize and synchronize `BORG_MASTER_INDEX.jsonc` from `scripts/resources-list.json` and `scripts/ingestion-status.json`.
  - Added `scripts/ingestion-status.json` for explicit processed/pending/failed outcome tracking and failure retry seeds.
  - Added root script alias: `npm run index:sync`.

### Fixed

- **API Router Refactoring (Database Decoupling)**:
  - Refactored `toolsRouter` to use `ToolRegistry` instead of direct DB storage, resolving persistent type errors and aligning with MetaMCP architecture.
  - Refactored `savedScriptsRouter` to use `JsonConfigProvider`, utilizing `mcp.json` as the single source of truth for script storage.
  - Standardized tool naming convention to `server__tool` across `MetaMCPController` and `ToolRegistry`.
  - Created `common-utils.ts` to fully decouple utility functions from lingering database dependencies.

### Changed

- **Master Index Schema Upgrade**:
  - Upgraded `BORG_MASTER_INDEX.jsonc` to schema `borg-master-index/v2`.
  - Added ingestion telemetry (`ingestion.sources`, `ingestion.queue`) and expanded per-entry metadata (`fetch_status`, `fetch_error`, `fetch_attempts`, `last_checked_at`, `processed_at`, `normalized_url`, `discovered_from`).
  - Synced canonical corpus to 565 tracked links with queue visibility (`processed=6`, `pending=558`, `failed=1`).

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Phase 67: MetaMCP Submodule Assimilation**:
  - Added `https://github.com/robertpelloni/MetaMCP` as a Git submodule at `external/MetaMCP/`.
  - Registered `external/MetaMCP/packages/*` and `external/MetaMCP/apps/*` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` as first-class workspace members.
  - Resolved 100+ `<<<<<<< HEAD` merge conflict markers across MetaMCP TypeScript source files via automated script.
  - Modified `external/MetaMCP/apps/backend/tsup.config.ts` to emit a separate library bundle at `dist/metamcp.js` alongside the main Express server.
  - Created `packages/core/src/services/MetaMCPBridgeService.ts` — a typed HTTP client allowing Borg to communicate with the MetaMCP backend at `http://localhost:12009`.
  - Added 4 new TRPC procedures to `mcpServersRouter`: `listFromMetaMCP`, `metamcpStatus`, `createInMetaMCP`, `deleteFromMetaMCP`.
  - Created ambient TypeScript declaration shim `packages/core/src/types/backend-metamcp.d.ts`.

  - Fixed `NaN` depth input propagation in `/dashboard/research` by introducing string-backed numeric input parsing + clamping.
  - Removed Chronicle render loop (`Maximum update depth`) by switching merged timeline derivation to memoized computation.
  - Added same-origin Next.js tRPC route (`/api/trpc`) and updated `TRPCProvider` fallback resolution to avoid default cross-origin `:4000` failures.
  - Hardened websocket-heavy dashboard widgets (`TrafficInspector`, `MirrorView`, `ResearchPanel`, `CouncilDebateWidget`) with configurable URLs and bounded reconnect behavior.
  - Centralized runtime endpoint resolution in `packages/ui/src/lib/endpoints.ts` and migrated dashboard/terminal consumers to shared helpers (`resolveTrpcHttpUrl`, `resolveCoreWsUrl`, `resolveCouncilWsUrl`, `resolveTerminalWsUrl`, `resolveCliApiBaseUrl`).
  - Added shared reconnect policy utilities in `packages/ui/src/lib/connection-policy.ts` (`createReconnectPolicy`, `shouldRetryReconnect`, `getReconnectDelayMs`, `normalizeNumericInput`) and migrated websocket widgets to exponential backoff + capped retries.
- **Backend realism closure (P0 implementation pass)**:
  - Replaced simulated `savedScripts.execute` with real `CodeExecutorService` execution + structured timing metadata.
  - Replaced OAuth exchange stub with live provider token exchange flow in `oauthRouter.exchange` (session/client validation, token request, schema-validated persistence).
  - Rewired `agentRouter.chat` to live `llmService` generation with graceful degraded fallback behavior.
  - Replaced `agents/Researcher` stub output generation with model-backed synthesis + JSON extraction fallback.
  - Replaced key MetaMCP proxy stub adapters for code execution, saved script CRUD/execution, tool search, and tool persistence with repository/service-backed implementations.

  - Added `apps/web` Jules API proxy route (`/api/jules`) for authenticated Jules API passthrough.
  - Added Jules card on dashboard home for direct discoverability.
  - Added `PATCH` support to Jules proxy routes (`apps/web` and `packages/ui`) for session updates.
  - Implemented baseline `updateSession` support in `packages/ui/src/lib/jules/client.ts` with graceful fallback for API versions lacking `PATCH`.
  - Wired Kanban drag/drop status transitions to attempt Jules cloud sync while retaining local persistence fallback.
  - Added in-page Jules connectivity controls on `/dashboard/jules` (save/clear API key + live `/api/jules` proxy test + status feedback).
  - Added "Last Sync Results" panel on `/dashboard/jules` backed by persisted session update telemetry for quick troubleshooting.

### Changed

  - Added new `browser` tRPC router with runtime status and page lifecycle controls.
  - Added new `mesh` tRPC router with runtime status and broadcast capability.
  - Added typed Browser/Mesh service helper accessors in `trpc-core` and lightweight status helpers in both services.
